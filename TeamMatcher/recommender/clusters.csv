0,0,1,"Data Driven DJ will be an application that uses artist, album, song, tags, and lyrics data from multiple sources to allow for users to determine what other artists or songs they may be interesting in based off their current music tastes. Data will be pulled from various sources such as APIs and possibly web scraping. Users will be allowed to search for artists, albums, songs, song tags, and artist topics. Artists can be selected to view their Albums, common topics that they sing about, and a word cloud of their most commonly used words. Artist topics can be selected to view artists with the same topics. Albums can be selected to view the songs on a given album. Songs can be selected to view their lyrics, and their related tags. When viewing a song, users will be able to add or vote towards current tags for that particular song. Tags can be selected to view songs with the same tag.UsefulnessThere are similar applications that provide functionality close to this application, however do not cover all aspects that we will be implementing.Similar Web ApplicationsAZLyricsDoes not allow song tags or artist topics.

It’s useful in the way that unlike Yahoo and RobinHood provide status quo analysis, the user can make their own analysis or judgement based on their customized query or dig into high volume social media information. With more advanced information, the user can beat the other competitor and gain profit.REALNESSThe data used for this project is all real data. A Python crawler is used to obtain data from various sources, including Yahoo Finance and Open Knowledge Foundation.We use all 500 constituents companies of S&P 500 index as our data sample. S&P 500 index is one the most popular broad stock market index used in the financial market.Three types of data are collected:Company profile data. It provides a summary of each company; the attributes include “enterprise value”, “total number of shares outstanding”, “sector”, “address”, “business summary”, etc.Stock summary data. It provides a most recent snapshot of each company’s stock information; the attributes include price/earning ratio, beta exposure to the entire stock market, average trading volume, dividend yield, previous 52-week high and low, etc.Stock price history: the daily price history spanning from 2000/1/1 to 2016/12/31 for all 500 stocks are scraped from Yahoo finance. In total, over 1 million records are stored and used for the price history data. Each data record includes information such as ticker, open price, intraday high and low, closing price and total trading volume.FUNCTIONALITYBASIC FUNCTIONSAs suggested above, we shall be using static data from Yahoo for working with our application and our database will contain relations for stocks, stock prices, users and user transactions. We will be able to add/update/delete stock records in the database as well for maintenance purposes (?). This way the users can query relations for specific company stocks, stocks with highest price, observe the daily highs and lows etc. These kinds of queries can be performed using join operations on two or more relations. Once users log into the website and buy/sell the stocks they want, the transaction would be added to the database along with their details. This information will be used for historical tracking purposes of stocks.ADVANCED FUNCTIONS:Stock recommendations based on Price and SectorUsefulness: Our application will be capturing the stock information in database along with their price as well as sectors (eg. tech). When users purchase/sell the stocks these transactions will be captured in our tables as well. So when they sign in to make their next transaction, they would be able to see possible stock suggestions based on their own personal history of past transactions. Additionally, these suggestions would be further filtered by sectors/prices etc so the user can browse all categories with ease. This will add a personal touch for each user with respect to what stocks they see, making our application more useful and intuitive for them.Challenge: This would be a bit challenging for us to implement in technical terms since we will have to add constant monitoring capabilities for individual user transactions. Also this information will have to be stored and maintained for them in a way that it does not mix with other users’ transactions so as to make the suggestions personal. This would involve having a customized polling approach that looks out for specific transactions on tables and verify the suggestions via thorough testing.Novelty: This feature would be different from other similar applications because usually they indicate the current in-demand stocks based on live stock exchange status rather than user’s choices. This would separate our application from others by making it more customizable and handy from the user’s perspective.2. Display “hot” stocks based on history of user transactionsUsefulness: This feature imparts a clean perspective to users as well by helping them see what the other users have been buying lately. By observing which stocks sell the most, the novice users can get a clear idea about what is the current status of the stock market without being overwhelmed by all the exhaustive information available on the web. Experienced users might be comfortable doing this, but when the novice users are starting within the stock-market world, it could be scary for them to absorb all of the market stock patterns at once. Here our feature will prove instrumental in guiding them practically by displaying only the important information in a brief manner, such as the most frequently bought stocks by users. This will start them off to say the least and start gaining a footing, after which they can browse and explore more options as required.Challenge: This will prove to be challenging for us because we will have to monitor the user’s personal transaction history as well as that of the whole user domain in order to display personal as well as general stock recommendations. That hard part would be to separate both features and have individual pollers/analysers for the existing stock trends. That way, we can determine the user-based personal stock recommendations as well as the maximum number of stocks bought by all users for generic recommendations. Also these analysers will have to be fully tested to make sure their behavior is FAD and also that these recommendations change over time based on dynamic user transaction data.Novelty: Again, this approach is different than what the similar applications use because they display everything related to stock trends on their websites. By displaying a sub-set of information based on current user transactions, we impart our application the ability to represent the same stock patterns in a more understable and lucid manner. This guarantees a more user-friendly, time-saving and pleasant UI browsing experience for users which increases the user satisfaction.3. Portfolio Volatility calculatorUsefulness: This will provide a real time risk measure of the user’s portfolio and enables the users to understand the risk of their portfolios and help them make better investment decisions.Challenge: The portfolio volatility calculator will depend on both stock information and the portfolio information in each user’s account. Ideally it would also pre-calculate volatility impact for any stock the user intends to buy or sell.Novelty: The feature is not currently observed in the major finance or stock broker websites.a the website. It’s useful in the way that unlike Yahoo and RobinHood provide status quo analysis, the user can make their own analysis or judgement based on their customized query or dig into high volume social media information.

Display “hot” stocks based on history of user transactionsUsefulness: This feature imparts a clean perspective to users as well by helping them see what the other users have been buying lately. By observing which stocks sell the most, the novice users can get a clear idea about what is the current status of the stock market without being overwhelmed by all the exhaustive information available on the web. Experienced users might be comfortable doing this, but when the novice users are starting within the stock-market world, it could be scary for them to absorb all of the market stock patterns at once. Here our feature will prove instrumental in guiding them practically by displaying only the important information in a brief manner, such as the most frequently bought stocks by users. This will start them off to say the least and start gaining a footing, after which they can browse and explore more options as required.Challenge: This will prove to be challenging for us because we will have to monitor the user’s personal transaction history as well as that of the whole user domain in order to display personal as well as general stock recommendations. That hard part would be to separate both features and have individual pollers/analysers for the existing stock trends. That way, we can determine the user-based personal stock recommendations as well as the maximum number of stocks bought by all users for generic recommendations. Also these analysers will have to be fully tested to make sure their behavior is FAD and also that these recommendations change over time based on dynamic user transaction data.Novelty: Again, this approach is different than what the similar applications use because they display everything related to stock trends on their websites. By displaying a sub-set of information based on current user transactions, we impart our application the ability to represent the same stock patterns in a more understable and lucid manner. This guarantees a more user-friendly, time-saving and pleasant UI browsing experience for users which increases the user satisfaction.3. Portfolio Volatility calculatorUsefulness: This will provide a real time risk measure of the user’s portfolio and enables the users to understand the risk of their portfolios and help them make better investment decisions.Challenge: The portfolio volatility calculator will depend on both stock information and the portfolio information in each user’s account. Ideally it would also pre-calculate volatility impact for any stock the user intends to buy or sell.Novelty: The feature is not currently observed in the major finance or stock broker websites."
3,3,10,"DescriptionOur goal is to help people who want to pursue an engineering master's degree to find the most appropriate academic programs, according to their desired school ranking, location, applicant’s GPA, GRE and other indicators. Also, based on the essential function of our website, we build a sharing platform that users can share their comments on a specific program and an admission prediction function that using users’ application results to get the admission probability of programs.UsefulnessWhen people want to apply for graduate school, the general procedures waste much precious time. People need to look through dozens of the official website of universities, filter their desiring schools manually during to schools’ ranking or location and so on, then compare the program’s requirements related to their major and their real truth. These manual procedures can be optimized by computer technology.There already are some helpful websites such as US News that can enumerate the top ranking of universities and programs. However, US News cannot restrict the specific condition such as GPA and GRE, and it cannot combine the requirements from clients and find the most appropriate programs for clients. Also, clients of US News cannot share their comments on a specific program which could be very helpful for other applicants.Our website fixes all the problems mentioned above. We will combine the requirements from students and consider students’ basic information, then find and recommend them the most appropriate programs. Also, the comment function and admission prediction function are very helpful for the clients in our website to assess their desiring programs comprehensively.RealnessThe school ranking and program ranking will be collected from US News. The data related to specific school and program such as school’s location, Tel., minimum GPA and so on will be collected from their official websites. Description of the functionalityI.         Basic Functions:1.	Considering the data’s reality and usefulness, we decide to scratch some real-time data from USNews.com, www.harvard.edu, www.uiuc.edu, etc. more than 100 websites, to crawl raw data like contact info, campus location, postal code and so forth.2.	Use mySQL language to insert/update/delete records to the database.3.	Use mySQL language to show tables joint, filter, and so on search operations.4.	Add comments of users into database, like creating a table, comment (userid, programid, commentNo, date, content, grades and marks,)II.         Advanced Functions:1. Visualize university info on dynamic U.S. map.1)    Prepare the map canvas used for hitting universities on2)    According to user’s request, end-front will calculate and fetch the satisfying results from database, and get and project the address information onto map canvas.  3)    Program front-end application, to pop up bubbles, which stands for an university located on that place on map, once the request enquiry has got correct returned data; and once user wants to move mouse onto one bubble, there would be a little widget putting up and shows the university information like address, rank, websites, application requirement info and so forth.4)    Move mouse to other bubble, and repeat step (c).5)    Click on bubble, a super link will occur and bring user to specific university page.2.  Recommendation System1)    Users input their one or two target school2)    Do pattern mining based on all users applications according to users' target school2)    Generate a list of schools and list them on website 3.  Real-time Data Capture1)    Implement web crawler to collect programs information from college rank websites and related programs official websites.2)    When users search for programs information, web crawler captures data from related websites automatically to make sure programs information are up-to-date"
4,4,8,"Description:We will be developing Accipere (pronounced “ah-chi-PE-ray”), a mobile-friendly Web application for managing receipts digitally and providing users with data on how they spend their money. Usefulness:The application will be useful because it will let you view all your spending in one place, without having to log in to all your bank accounts and then having to write down or calculate all your spending over multiple websites. It will also let you see what items you spent your money on, without forcing you to keep physical copies of the receipt.There are a few different websites with mobile apps available, including https://www.concur.com/, https://www.shoeboxed.com/, and https://www.certify.com/, among others. Our application will be different from theirs because it will be more geared towards individual users, and it will allow you to choose which form of payment you used to pay for the receipt, including be able to choose which account you used to pay for it (credit card 1, credit card 2, debit card 1, checking account 4, etc) Realness:1.	Data Collection: We’ll have real users taking pictures of receipts with their phones and interacting with the central server via a Web interface.  Most people have to deal with receipts on a daily basis, so plenty of data will be available.  Basic Functions:1.	Insert/Update/Delete a.	We will insert records into the database when creating a new account, creating a new receipt, and starting a new login session. b.	We will update records by allowing users to change information related to their account and allowing supporting data for receipts to be modified. c.	We will delete records in the database by allowing our users to remove purchases from their history of past purchases.  Advanced Functions:1.	One of the advanced features we would like to include is optical character recognition (OCR). This would allow data such as the purchase total to be automatically read from a receipt rather than being manually entered by the user. We think this would be a cool feature, as it would allow users to more quickly store their purchase information in our application, and would just be a great quality-of-life feature. 2.	The second advanced feature we would like to implement is heat mapping of users spending habits. This would create a graphical representation of where the user(s) is making purchases based on how many purchases have been recorded within a certain geographical area. We thought this would be a cool feature because it would allow the user to graphically see where they are spending their money, but it could also be of use to businesses, who could potentially use a heat map of all of our users purchase data to determine which areas are hot spots to open stores at. "

6,6,7,"Description•	Rate My Classroom is an idea similar to that of Rate My Professor, except instead of rating the quality of people or classes, it rates the quality of the classrooms.•	The site would allow users to give an overall rating to the classrooms and lecture halls they have attended class in, write descriptions of their experiences there, and add tags for specific aspects of the rooms. •	Such examples of tags would be:  no leg room, no lefty desks, lots of broken desks, air conditioning (yes or no).•	Users would be able to utilize reviews left by others to help search their potential classrooms and see whether or not they want to consider switching sections to a different classroom.   •	Along with searching information about individual classrooms, users could search for certain features (tags) and get a list of all the classrooms that have those specified features.  •	For example, a user looking for classrooms with air conditioning, leg room, comfy chairs might get a list that includes such rooms as DCL 1320, ECEB 1002, and Siebel 1404.   •	Another feature includes the ability to see if two classrooms are able to be traveled between in the standard 10 minute passing period.  This would include traveling by foot, bike, and public transportation. Usefulness•	To get the information on what buildings/classrooms are used for classes, as well as what classes are taught in each building, the UIUC Course Explorer API would be used – the results of these searches would be stored in a database.•	The actual ratings and tags for each classroom would be user generated. •	The information about the travel time between buildings would be derived from the Google Maps API.•	The travel time between each building on campus is stored in a database.•	Walking and bike times are stored •	Bus time is a live-lookup due to time-of-day sensitivityDescription of FunctionalityBasic Functionality•	Storing Reviews •	Viewing Reviews •	Applying filters to search data by tags •	Adding tags to classrooms •	Creating user account •	Login as user •	Logout of user Advanced Functionality•	Allowing users to find buildings with the features they desire that are within walking or biking range of a specific building•	The information about the travel time between buildings would be derived from the Google Maps API (with the travel time between each building on campus stored into a database)."
7,7,4,"DescriptionPeople often meet a problem: I want to check out a new restaurant or watch a movie or going somewhere, but no one goes with me. This is a common problem among a lot of people. So we are planning to design a website to help people find mates to do something together. We call the website GoTogether. On GoTogether, people can view other people’s proposed event, propose event and look for mates or find/provide a free ride. UsefulnessThere is no unified platform to look for mates and people are in need of such platform. Facebook Group is currently a similar platform. Facebook group is created and maintained by individual. There may exist multiple groups for just movie watching. Users may miss an event if they are not in the group. They may also have a hard time on deciding which group to join in and they may found themselves lost in massive and unorganized posts.  On GoTogether, you don’t need to join a group to propose an event or check what others proposed. You will not miss a post and posts are organized by category(movie, restaurant, etc). RealnessWe will create user profiles and posts manually.  User profile will contain user’s username, email address. For free ride post data, it will contain post id, user id, event start date, event end date, seats number, destination and current location. For other post data(movie, restaurant, etc), it will contain post id, user id, event start date, event end date, category and location. All Posts data will also contain comment message. Notification Description of the functionality: Basic Functions:1.	User login/logout/registration/update profile. 2.	Users can make a post or delete a post on events they are interested in. For example, they can invite people to have dinner or watch movie together; they are allowed to offer a lift or request for free-riding. 3.	Posts are categorized and user can filter post based on its preference or search for specific contents included in posts. 4.	User can reply to a post or start an asynchronous conversation with people who have common interests. 5.	User gets notification when people are interested in his/her event or their individual demands can be potentially satisfied by particular posts.  Advanced Functions: (1)Geographical Clustering and Path OptimizationFor students who offer a lift (named as provider) and who request free-riding (named as requester), their location should be considered. We store current location of both providers and requesters in database and keep a record of their destination. If some requesters have the same destination as well as similar time, we should perform geographical clustering based on their location to form different groups. The groups are then assigned to a couple of nearby providers depending on their locations. In this sense, each provider is in charge of several requesters in his/her neighborhood without driving far away to pick up other requesters. After the group and corresponding provider are determined, a recommended path should be generated for providers to pick up each requester in his group. The path is computed based on a weighted graph derived from local maps and should be optimized to reduce the total cost of routing. Tentatively, the clustering can be implemented by K-means algorithm and the path optimization can leverage approaches designed for Dijkstra and Travel Salesman Problem. (2)Related Events RecommendationWe will use data mining technique and based on user’s viewing, searching and posting history to recommend event or other user. For example, using TFIDF to compare post similarity. More data mining technique will be added as we go deep into the project."
8,8,5,"Description:We will be developing a platform for matching coders based on collaborative potential for community proposed projects. We believe one of the primary obstacles for programmers with great ideas that want to get off the ground is the lack of manpower needed to build a project from the ground up.  Propose a project and find collaborators, or be a developer looking for a project to join.Usefulness:While there exist plenty of Coder-Centric online communities, tools and platforms such as Stack Overflow, Quora, Github, TopCoder, there is no single platform which specializes as a social network to help coders find collaborators for projects. We hope new programmers will be able to gain extensive experience coding and working collaboratively while learning associated tools, and that experienced coders will find, and build, great teams to bring their ideas to fruition. Realness:Our data will come from registered users. Information such as languages used, years of experience, projects joined and proposed, collaborators found, location, fields of interests, and many other factors including GitHub stats and other third parties such as HackerRank.Functionality:Basic:•	Creating and modifying a User Profile. A User Profile will showcase the users past projects, their experience and their skills.•	Creating and modifying a Project Profile. A Project Profile will showcase the project aims and goals, and the project progress.•	Basic Search for Users.•	Basic Search for Project.•	Creating a 'Network' - connecting users to users, and users to projects. A 'Network' could contain a recommendation and expertise verification system. However, such a system would have to be carefully implemented.Advanced:•	Search interface - Allow searching with boolean operators (AND/OR/NOT), wildcards and truncation, predictive suggestions and spelling correction, keyword grouping, and customization of filters for languages, fields of expertise, project topics, etc. Possibly also related suggestions such as ""We think you might find these users/projects interesting:"". Design of results ranking to allow active developers with less experience to gain exposure, and to prioritize active developers over inactive ones.   •	Matching algorithm - Developers will see a percentage on other developer profiles indicating their predicted compatibility. This percentage is meant to give developers a good idea of how effective/positive a collaborative relationship may be with each other. Our algorithm will be based on basic profile data provided by developers (interests, languages, experience, etc), as well as a set of behavioral questions (written by us and the community) they answer, assigning priority for themselves and others. Questions such as ""I prefer to take on a leadership role:"", ""Tabs or spaces:"", ""I think it is important to have bi-weekly team meetings:"", as well as others.  •	Real-time visualizations modifiable with filters (language, topic, expertise, remote, developer experience, average team experience, etc)  - network graph of collaborations, project traffic, community stats, demand for X, etc. Why? Because data is beautiful. Using visualizations may allow us to tap into the growing availability of online coding challenges through gamification. This would allow us to create a system that would allow us to reward completing these challenges in a public setting, where the other users are aware of how easy or difficult these challenges are."
9,9,2,"project summary:   A webpage platform that give users recommendations of healthy food and allows users to search for food based on categories and calories as well as order and receive orders from other users. DescriptionIn US colleges, it is really hard to eat healthy: there are limited choices of restaurants, and a lot of restaurants are expensive and not healthy. Dining hall does provide healthy choices of food but is overpriced and only offer meal of limited time: 12 dollars for lunch and 15 dollars for dinner. Often, college students do not have time to have healthy meals every time. Too often, college students don’t have time to calculate the calories for each meal combining the results with the suggestions of how many calories they should intake per day.Our project recommends healthy food choices based on calories and nutrition facts. It also serves as a buy/sell platform of homemade healthy food at lower prices(no intermediate costs), in which users can search for food, order food, sell food and receive recommendation of the intake calories per day as well as fitness facts at one place. Usefulness  Our application is somewhat similar to regular take-out restaurant website and app, such as Grubhub and Orderup that focu on online food ordering. Moreover, our application will recommend food and restaurants based on the calories the users need to intake per day, and get fitness facts and suggestions of healthy diet and eating.1.	Users would like to know more about healthy diet and eating. To help them achieve this goal, this webpage will  give customers the information of how many calories it contains in the food of their choices, the application will also calculate the suggested amount of calories intake based on the users’ personal information when they create their accounts. 2.	We will build a chat platform, so customers can chat with sellers or other users to order food. This is a very useful functions especially when customers don’t know what to choose and have specific requirements of the food they choose.    Realness  Data types:•	User’s basic information related to fitness •	Nutrition fact of food/dishes •	Health advice and fitness recommendations •	Restaurant information Data resources:•	Yelp/Google review •	Nutrition fact database(myfitnesspal.com, etc) •	Grubhub      Functionality Basic Functions:•	Log in / out •	User information storage •	Food search based on taste, calories, nutrition, price and others •	Calculation of recommendation of Calories intake per day•	Platform for buying and selling food Advanced Functions:•	Real-time chat with other users/restaurants •	Food / restaurant recommendations "
10,10,5,"Functional Description:        This project aims to help people who want to search for housing renting information. The project will feature a database based on housing information. Because of the presence of many areas or regions like Urbana-Champaign which is populated with out-of-state/alien residents like international students, faculties and many other diverse groups of people, the market for renting information is in great demand. Therefore, we decide to build a platform that targets this group of people.        The platform will require users to sign up for an account and be logged in to look at renting information. The sign-up process, as you can imagine, asks for a username, a password, and other optional information like their age or major to contribute to the recommendation system used later. Users will have their own profiles based on their sign-up information. The information includes but is not limited to their phone numbers, email addresses and so on. They will be able to edit their profile if they wish later.         Housing/renting information will contain attributes including but is not limited to location, price, size and housing conditions. Users can browse the housing information with their specified requirements on attributes like location, rent, size and facilities.         Users can add houses to their favorite lists, which is maintained in the database. Users will be able to set, modify or delete their favorite list.  Also the browse history of the users will be automatically saved and can be modified or deleted by the users. The browse history combined with the favorite list will be used for the back-end to dynamically produce recommendations to the users.         One of the advanced techniques of this project is the recommendation system. As mentioned, the database keeps a track of the users' favorite list and browse history. Using machine learning techniques and other advanced algorithms like nearest neighbor clustering algorithm, the system will be able to generate (ideally) high quality recommendations to users. The users can give either a positive or negative feedback to help improve results.        The other advanced techniques is smart search. We will allow users to make queries like ""houses within 10-min (distance) walking (means of transportation) distance from Grainger(center location)"" and ""houses with four bedrooms, at least two bathroom, and dryer and washer"". The system will return the best fitting results based on users' request. "

13,13,6,"a. Description Up in the Air is a website that records and provides statistical analysis of the history of the users’ flights, airlines and airports. There would be a personalized travel map, which marks the added flights. It is available for the users to add relative photos and comments to flights, airports and airlines. And they can also find friends with same or similar schedules, chat with their friends online and check the details of their flights if they are allowed.b. UsefulnessUp in the Air can be an effective way for the travelers to keep track of their flights of where you've been and how you got there. It is also a social platform, where the users can contact with friends in the same flight. One similar web application with ours is called “Flightdiary”. Both two websites record and analyze flight information of the users. But in Up in the Air, we provide the functionality for comment and upload picture for including each airlines, airports and flights for people.  we also provide searching for friends on same or similar flights, which is not available on Flightdiary, while ours can search for friends based on their sharable flight information like dates and airlines. Online chatting is available between friends. c. RealnessThe data our web will deal with will be divided into six entity sets: User, Comment, Flight Record, Aircraft, Airline and Airport. The User relation will contain attributes id, name, account and password. These data will be gotten directly from input of users. The entity set Flight Record will include attributes like ID, flight number, date, depart time, arrival time, class, seat, and purpose. These data will comes from user when they add a flight to their account. However, our website will also automatically search for source airport and destination airport information for them. The comment will be a weak entity set supported by User sets. The comment will contains attributes like timestamp, content, URL of photos. These data will also be gotten directly from input of users. The data such as Airport, Airline and Aircraft will be directly crawl from online free database (Openflight.org). For airport, it will contains attributes like ID, name, city, country, ICAO, IATA. For aircraft, it will contains attributes like ID, model, manufacturer. For airline, it will contains attributes like: ID, name, country, ICAO, IATA. All of the data we are talking about is easy to retrieve and meaningful in our design.d. FunctionalityBasic Functions:1.	An account system where the user can login with their email address and password. In the account the users are able to add new flights their flight record, add comments and add friends for chatting. Users are able to look through the history of his flights and informations and even query from the website to see statistics and graph of their trip records. 2.	The searching system of information of a specific airline, airport or flight to read comments and see pictures of airports from other users to have a better knowledge about their trip in advance.Advanced Functions:1.	Social Mail: The website will allow user to search for people to share the same trip and chat with them in advance, so people may have friends during the boring flight.2.	Recommendation: The website will give information including comments and pictures from other users for people to consider the specific airline to take or specific airport to land once input a flight intention."
14,14,2,"•	Description  Can not decide what to eat? Hard to make choice every time? Deciding a place for lunch could sometimes be a super annoying and energy consuming progress. This App saves those who has OCD in making food decision. Unlike common recipe recommendation App, we do not simply providing information to you, we are trying to make choice for you. Based on the feature data of restaurants and user behavior, we utilize Machine Learning algorithm to figure out users' preference model and recommend restaurants which the user are very likely to enjoy. By collecting user's feedback, we can constantly revise the model and make the recommendation more precisely.   •	Usefulness.   Our application is designed to help you make decisions for choosing what to eat. It recommends restaurants for users based on preference Q&A and users' meal history. For example, it will avoid recommending food that a user just had yesterday. If no preference given, the application will randomly pick one based only on history. It will be similar to some other restaurant rating or recommendation applications like Yelp, but not the same because it is not only a list of restaurant information but most importantly, a decision maker of what to eat.  •	Realness.   Our Data is the restaurant information in Champaign, including the name, address, food menu, food style and rate and so on. The data could be collected by searching form the existing food recommendation app such as Yelp. In addition, the data could also be created by users themselves.   •	Description of the functionality that you plan to offer. This is where you talk about how to meet the advanced functionality requirements.  There are two types of functions you need to offera.	 Basic Functions:  1. showing data of the restaurants and their menu 2. adding new data entry, deleting data entry, update data entry  3. query and return the corresponding resultsb.	Advanced Functions: 1. recommend restaurants based on preference Q&A answers and features of each restaurant.  2. adjust the users' preference model with Machine Learning algorithms based on users' history.   These advanced functions are cool because they will provide more personal recommendations to each user. We are applying Machine Learning algorithms to avoid recommending the same restaurant the user had yesterday. Theses functions also allow us to match restaurants with users' preferences better. "
15,15,9,"DescriptionThe goal of the project is to produce a fantasy sports website for University of Illinois sports.  This fantasy sports game will support the bulk of the NCAA sports played by athletes at the University of Illinois.  Participants will compete by selecting fantasy athletes from the various supported sports.  This fantasy game is cross-sport, so that gymnasts, basketball players, and tennis players can all be part of the same team.UsefulnessThis application has two synergistic purposes.  The most obvious purpose is that it is a game which should be entertaining to participants.  Fantasy sports have been around for over a decade and is well-established as entertainment.  However, our application is different from every existing fantasy sport application in that participants can assemble fantasy teams using athletes from multiple sports, to compete against each other on the basis of statistical models configured by users (not hard-coded in our application) at the start of each virtual ""tournament"".  The players may come from any Illini sport competing during the time frame of the fantasy tournament. This is a design challenge as the statistics of a gymnast need to be normalized in some manner to the statistics of a basketball player.  The second, ancillary purpose of the application is that it will help to promote the lesser-viewed college sports as anyone competing in our fantasy tournaments will have an extra incentive to learn about and follow all Illini sports - not just those gaining attention from ESPN.RealnessThe bulk of our data are statistics from NCAA athletes competing in University of Illinois sports. This data is available through the University of Illinois ""fighting Illini"" website.  For the production of the prototype, we will use statistics from the past as a proxy for real-time data.FunctionalityBasic Functions1.	Real Illini sports data will be collected.  This data exists as pdf's on the Illini website.  Pdf is not the best format for crawling so we will consider requesting the data in a more amenable format from the athletic department.2.	User / participant accounts will be created for a sufficient number of users to hold fantasy tournaments.3.	Insert/update/delete will be used for user account information (passwords, etc.) as well as tournament creation.4.	Advanced searches using table joins will be used to determine the winners of individual tournaments.  This will require joining sports statistics across various diverse sports along athletes chosen by the participants.5.	Additional searches will be available to view past performance so participants can make informed decision on assembling their best fantasy team.Advanced FunctionsFunction #1Users will be able to initiate tournaments in which they can dynamically establish their own game rules, for example, dynamic weighting of the relative importance of sport/athlete performance metrics. In this manner, tournament designers can build individual rule sets which emphasize the diversity of Illini athletics as well as require research and skill to win rather than simple luck.Function #2 One complexity of building a fantasy application which spans multiple sports is how to measure ""great"" performance vs. mediocre or poor.  Our second advance functionality will be to design individual sport performance metrics based on their relative deviation from the average.  For instance, if the standard number of rebounds for a basketball player is 2 per quarter per game, 4 would add many fantasy points while 1 would provide few if any.  Similar metrics can be designed for other sports - for instance, the average number of aces during a tennis match may be 20.  25 aces would result in a large bolus of fantasy sports while 10 would be few if any."

19,19,0,"Our project is to build a tiny-Amazon bookstore called Atacama. We will focus on freely-distributable ebooks since we can actually deliver them. We hope to accumulate a database of ebooks from sites like Project Gutenberg and Creative Commons. We’d like to add some visualization functionality to the current way Kindle books are displayed. Time permitting, we’d like to look into building the e-reader infrastructure. Currently, there are sites that offer eBook downloads, but the problem we are solving is it is difficult to find new public domain eBooks and read it online without a download.UsefulnessOur chosen application is useful because there currently does not exist an equivalent website that allows a user to read new public domain eBooks on the site without a download required. There are a few similar websites like Project Gutenberg that have available eBooks, but it is difficult to search for them and a user has to download specific books to read them.Similar Web Applications:•	Kindle Books Store•	Commercial online book store that allows you to pay to download and read books on the Amazon Kindle App•	Scribd•	Allows you to read a few books for a monthly membership cost, but our website will have additional features such as a visualization of the various eBooks.•	Project Gutenberg•	public resource with free books, but you can't view them, and you can't really interact with the data much.RealnessBooks will be extracted from public domain sources such Project Gutenberg and Creative Commons.

The search algorithm will be based on statistical methods such as Term Frequency/Inverse Document Frequency. We will perform stemming on both the documents and the search terms so that you don’t need to use the correct verb form or pluralization when searching. We will also do synonym compression so that you can search for either color or colour, and they will return the same results. The results would be sorted by a weighted combination of relevancy to your search terms, average rating for the book, and the number of people who have both looked at, and finished reading the book. The search functionality will also allow drilling down on search results using faceted browsing - this will be similar to the panel on the left of Amazon search results which let you further filter your results. An extension on this advanced feature is to include entity extraction on the book text, which would allow searching for things such as main characters (this will allow you to execute queries such as author:”Brandon Sanderson” AND character:”Rand”, which would return all books that are authored by Brandon Sanderson and contain a character named Rand).Advanced Feature 2A book recommendation engine visualized as a graph with D3.js: A user may want recommendations for their next book. We will use statistical methods based on word frequency and book features/tags to generate which books are strongly related to their current book(s), and which of those books are related to each other, and perhaps branch further with more related books. The user will see how similar books are related to each other, and choose to navigate to their next book."

Such service will be provided by saving user information on database systems. Furthermore, the system will use the stored data to recommend possible team compositions to user who have expertise and interests well suited for the project at hand. A.DescriptionWe intend to build a system that helps students to form a well-balanced team for a specific project. For example, for CS411 this year finding a team was a challenge as the class is very large and there are too many students/projects to consider. Our system would accept the description of the project, a set of skills each student has and will try to find a best match for a group of a certain size. B. UsefulnessSince the system is going to be used for helping students to form well-balanced teams for their projects, it might save their time, result in better teams and eventually lead to more interesting and successful projects. Instead of checking Piazza posts and their emails for hours, in an attempt to find a perfect match, our system will suggest best possible options for a specific student that will be well organized and easy to assess. The system will eliminate the initial confusion of trying to form a team in classes as large as CS411 is. C. RealnessWe will be using a list of descriptions and members from the previous projects of CS411. We also plan to gather our CS411 classmates’ attributes via survey and crawl project descriptions from the project pages. (and form groups within our class and see if the virtually formed groups match the original groups.) D. Description of the functionality that you plan to offer. I.

Transmitting the cook culture worldwide.b. UsefulnessThere exist a few cooking tutorial websites/applications already. However, they either only focus on bakery or just sharing American style recipes. Our web app will be more comprehensive that includes worldwide categories such as Chinese or Indian recipe.Our website will provide a text and image based online cooking tutorials for users. They can search the ingredients they want to use in our website and get lots of different recipes for the ingredients they searched. Since a lot of people are having problems cooking meals or deciding what recipes they should cook, our website will both provide lots of recipe choices and a detailed text tutorial for each of the recipe in our database. The similar things compared to equivalent websites are basic layout for the main page and the recipe page, but we will provide a data visualization for user’s browsing history.  c. RealnessWe will collect our recipes from various sources: popular recipe websites, user inputted recipe, and our own recipes.d. FunctionalityBasic Functions:•	User can create an account by providing basic information such as username, password, real name, etc.•	Insert function: User can add his/her own cooking recipe to the database•	Update function: User can modify the recipe and update it to the database•	Delete function: User can delete his/her own recipe from the database•	Search function: Given particular tags, meal types or ingredients, etc., user will get a list of corresponding recipes          Example:                   -If you search “sweet”, you can get a list of dessert recipes.                   -If you input an ingredient or several ingredients, you can get a list of recipes containing those ingredient•	Comment function: users can leave a comment under the web page for a certain recipeAdvanced Functions:•	Recommendation:  We will recommend some recipes to user based on user’s viewed history, flavor, preferred cooking style and world cuisine type. •	MapOfFavorites: Initially it’s a world map. When the user add a recipe that belongs to certain category in their favorite list, a recipe image of that category will appear in the map based on its origin. For example, if user add a kung-pao chicken into their favorite list, then an image of classical Chinese food will appear at the map. When user click that image, a list of his/her favorite Chinese food will appear(and it should only have kung-pao chicken as its element by now.) Next time the user add certain Chinese food as his/her favorites, he/she should expect an update on that list. And we will add image(if that’s the first time that user add recipe of that category) or update the list once the user add a recipe into the favorite list."

The user will be able to upload unbiased content in order to pave the way for the new wave of journalism. The application will allow for a medium in which every day people are truly in charge of what news they consume by cutting out the middle man and obtaining primary sources of information. USEFULNESSThis project will bring transparency, accountability, and clarity to the way we find out about injustices in this world. People always complain about a news outlets heavy bias whether it be right leaning or left leaning. This application will allow users to create unadulterated content for the masses. REALNESS This project does have real world uses, as people will be able to share content that they have encountered in their daily life with other users of our app and with people around the world if they choose to.  FUNCTIONALITY      Basic Functions •	View media(audio, video, pictures) from users through a user feed •	Comment on media •	Post media to the feed, and add tags and a description to this media        Advanced Features •	 Data Management: Several key pieces of data will be both stored in and retrieved from the database in real-time (or close to real-time) •	User Experience: Although this seems like something belongs in the ""basic functions"", our UX will be one that the user is familiar with and has used before, but also one that is unique and jaw-dropping•	Customize a feed for each individual user, if they choose to ""like"" or ""ignore"" media with certain tags "
23,23,4,"DESCRIPTIONTweetory is a project that aims to provide a better understanding and visualization of events that are happening across the world. The user will be able to search for keywords in the tweets and also see how tweets relating to a certain event are spanning the world. USEFULNESS The project will allow users to get a better understanding of how daily events are impacting the world. Many a times a horrific event does not get covered because of where it happened. Sometimes people do not truly understand how the entire world has reacted to a certain event. Through our project, the user will be able to get a better understanding of what’s happening around the world and how people are reacting to it. REALNESS We are going to majorly use data gathered from the Twitter API thus ensuring that all data is real.

24,24,2,"Description: Stream Soup is an application that aims to help users by recommending TV shows based on the streaming services they use, their previously watched shows and their general entertainment preferences. The problem Stream Soup is attempting to solve is the disconnect between different streaming services and the content that they provide. A user should be able to simply check Stream Soup to find new/existing TV shows as opposed to logging in to several streaming websites such as Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, Crunchyroll, HBO etc. Along with this, there are several other features further explored in the functionality description section. Usefulness:Our application is more efficient than currently available resources because it eliminates the need for users to log in to various applications in order to find TV shows. The main competing application does not provide extra services that Stream Soup would, such as user reviews, recommendations (based on user preferences), integration with Facebook and usage analysis.Realness:Firstly, the primary database required for this project is one containing all of the different available streaming applications. Several streaming services provide a list of the TV shows and films available. Using a basic web scraping tool, such as ""Beautiful Soup"", the relevant data can be extracted and combined to form a larger, more comprehensive database. Several attributes of each show would be recorded such as cast, genre, release year, etc. Another category of data Stream Soup would require would be the information about the users, their reviews and their streaming preferences. This would be obtained using Facebook and user-inputted information. Connecting to other review-based websites (eg. Rotten Tomatoes, imdb, Metacritic) can be directly accessed as opposed to expanding our own database.Functionality Description:Basic Functions:1.	Searching TV show database by attribute such as title, genre, year of release, cast member etc. 2.	Add/Remove shows based on new releases/removals from services 3.	Ability for user to add reviews for TV shows 4.	Link to rating websites  Advanced Functions:1.	Integration with Facebook to get friends’ recommendations a.	This is cool because having friends is cool (or so I’ve heard). In all seriousness, it provides a dimension of interactivity between friends and finding people with similar interests. 2.	Usage analysis of various streaming services. a.	This is cool because one can review the TV shows that they’ve seen on various services and determine which ones they would like to continue paying for and satisfy their curiosity in knowing how many hours of my life did I spend watching TV this year (cue existential crisis)? 3.	Weighting of user reviews a.	This is cool because not everyone uses the same mental scale to review shows, therefore this would normalize the data and give a better depiction of the overall show rating. Concerns:A lot of the data we require is not necessarily available for use, and therefore we anticipate running into certain roadblocks in the creation of Stream Soup. However, as with any project we plan to be adaptable to available resources by being dynamic with our functionalities."

Why?Students from engineering say there are too fewer girls in the same class, and girls from business college say that too fewer boys in the same class. With that being said, the gender ratio across colleges are very unbalanced. For students who spend most of their time in classes, labs, It’s kind of hard for them to find proper people to date.There are apps like Tinder, which can show people around.

We will scrape song lyrics to provide the ability to search by relevant keywords and provide more accurate recommendations. Users will then be able to offer feedback on the generated playlists, which will allow DropMuse to refine the recommendations to become more relevant to what the user wants.UsefulnessServices like Spotify generate playlists, but do not let users create playlists from keywords. We will be able to generate more relevant playlists by letting users seed our recommendation algorithm with songs and keywords that they are already interested in. We will also place an emphasis on using lyrics for song recommendations, which many other music services do not currently take into consideration.RealnessWe plan to scrape our lyric data from sites like Genius, AZLyrics, Lyricsplanet, etc. By combining these disparate sources of lyrics into one centralized service, we will be able to leverage this data to provide better recommendations. We will scrape song genre data and metadata from other music services like Spotify and Last.fmDescription of FunctionalityBasic Functionality•	Users will be able to sign up for accounts, and create playlists seeded by keywords •	Users will be able to navigate and view their playlists, and click links to listen to the songs. •	Users will be able to share the generated playlists with friends.Advanced Functionality•	We will perform sentiment analysis and entity extraction on our database of lyrics to better inform the algorithm we will use to generate playlists.

It solves the problem of having to rent a car or take a plane if you are going far away, and also reduces the overall cost of the trip per person by splitting up the cost for more people. •	Usefulness•	Our application is useful because it provides an easy and convenient way to get somewhere that you need to go if you don’t have a car or the money to rent one. Instead, you can carpool and use this app the find the person to drive you. •	There are similar ride sharing applications that already exist, such as Hitcharide, Ride, and Carma Carpool. Our application will be different because it will allow you to string together multiple rides and locations, as well as get off before the intended destination, in order to more flexibly allow people to get where they need to go.•	Realness•	We will use fake user posts as our data. Each fake post will be a user saying that they intend to drive somewhere, and then other users will be able to browse through these posts to join the rides. Also, we will use fake user comments that people leave on other people’s profiles as data. For the cost calculation, we will scrape gas data from http://gasprices.aaa.com/  •	Advanced Functionality•	Basic Functions•	Be able to create an account and log in to which is personal to each user•	Be able to create rides that other users are able to join. Rides will be update-able with new information (i.e. driver decides to change price).•	Be able to browse for rides that are near you or go to/start from a specific location.•	Be able to leave comments on users profiles, and upvote or downvote those comments. Also the ability to rate a user.•	Be able to block other users, so they don't see any rides that you are driving in.•	Advanced Functions•	We will use flexible graph traversal algorithms in order to connect riders with multiple ride providers in order to provide the best overall route from point A to point B. This is a cool feature because even if there is no ride going directly from point A to point B then you will still be able to get there - by going from A to C to B. Additionally, it will allow users to find the shortest trip- or even find trips that avoid certain areas or go through certain areas if they so choose. •	We will include an advanced cost estimation algorithm that accurately predicts what the total gas cost will be for the trip by using the actual gas prices in the areas the trip goes through and how long it is in those areas, as well as what vehicle they are using, so that ride providers will be able to charge a fair fee for each rider. This feature, along with the graph traversal algorithms, will allow us to provide users trips that are not only the shortest, but trips that are also the cheapest, which is a cool feature.•	No labels"
28,28,3,"Description•	IlliniPost is a platform that is designed for UIUC students in order to let them study, make friends, and relax better. At IlliniPost, there are three main sections including Q&A, entertainments, and classes information. In these three sections, students can post questions, reply, and keep track of certain posts they focused. For the user who doesn't want to sign up an account, they can use keyword search to find useful information they are looking for and also ask or answer questions. For the user who has an account, they can own a custom page after they login so they can focus on the category they care about most. By using at IlliniPost, students of UIUC can have easier and happy daily life.Usefulness•	(Why useful) First, Many UIUC students such as my friends have many questions about classes such as how many working loads does this class have, how to get A in this class, and where are the chatting groups of this class, and etc. They are also interested in finding good restaurants. However, currently, there is no single platform that can answer those questions together. Students have to find those questions separately,  and in most cases, they failed to find the answers of those questions because of lacking resources. However, our platform can collect answers of those questions together, and students can post and answer all the questions they focused on this platform, which is very convenient and useful.•	(Similar applications and their disadvantages) Currently, Yelp can recommend good restaurants, RateMyProfessors can recommend good professors, and Piazza can answer some questions about classes such as how many working load does this class have; however, each of them only has one single function, and students have to go to those websites one by one in order to find the answers. What's more, RateMyProfessors' answers are out of date since it only has the few answers about professors, and sometimes it even does not have any interviews about new professors. Piazza do have some answers about some classes, but they are not sorted well, and students sometimes who have taken this class could not see those questions at Piazza on time, so that they could not answer those questions.•	(Why our platform  is different) Our platform, the IlliniPost, can solve the above problems well. Since it is a unique and single platform that contains different sections, students can post all their questions in sorted sections, and students who want to answer those questions can see them on time by looking at specific sections. What's more, we will update the questions and answers on time so that users will not see the out of date information. Unlike Facebook, Twitter and other social networks, illiniPost aims at connecting the previous, current and future UIUC members, and together to make UIUC a better community.Realness•	Our website contains data from three parts: Q&A, entertainment and academic. We plan to use Web spider (python) to get data from various website. For Q&A and academic, we can grasp data from reddit, course hero, Quora and Blogs. For entertainment, we can see reviews from Yelp, Facebook and twitter.•	Also we can add data manually by either writing blogs and registering on our own or inviting UIUC students to post there blogs and questions in our website.Description of Functionality1.	Basic Functionality a.	Insertion: People will need to post their questions, answers and experiences on illinipost, so adding those data to database will be essential.b.	Deletion: Since we decide that unregistered user can also make a post on illinipost, it will be necessary for the administrator to delete spams and out of date posts.c.	Update: For the user who wants to add or edit their post, update information to database will also be necessary.d.	Search, list and return results: Search and return also play important roles in our website for users who is looking for a specific content.2.	Advanced Featuresa.	Hot-key clouds: In the main page, we will cross data from different websites, and analyze the search in our website. Present the popular keyword in the main page in a circle and all the keyword will move constantly in the circle clouds.  b.	Trace tracking: Based on the search data and post data, give user a customerized main page category showing in their main page. "

After watching games and relevant news, one user could favorite games and players, and leave comments about the game. Based on feedbacks, we will adjust our game recommendation. We will also do some manipulation and visualization of  game statistics, which will give users more insight into games. Usefulness State as clearly as possible why your chosen application is useful.  Make sure to answer the following questions: Are there any similar or equivalent web sites/applications out here?  If so, what are they and how is yours different?1. Avoiding repetitive and unavailable for game information, users could find what they want at one place.2. Improving user experience by offering personalized gaming schedule.3.

30,30,4,"DESCRIPTION/USEFULNESSWe will be creating an auction site with a social media component. eBay is the leader in the online auction world, but due to the fact that nearly any product can be publicly sold on eBay, it is often difficult for the user to find what he/she is looking for. One reason for this could be that sellers are not able to target their auctions to certain groups of people, requiring the buyers to scroll through many unrelated items to find the product they desire. Additionally, Facebook has buying and selling groups, for example, UIUC’s Textbook Exchange group. These groups lack the ability to coordinate auctions (they simply have a ""Message Seller"" button), so sellers can easily overprice or under-price their products, which is sub-optimal. We seek to harness the strengths of both services by combining them together into an auction website allowing you to only see auctions that are of interest to you.REALNESSOur product data will be collected from Amazon. We will be ""auctioning off"" these products. In addition, real people will be creating the user accounts and we will create pre-made groups for common interests, with the ability for users to create their own groups.BASIC FUNCTIONSThe basic functions of the website include:•	Create user accounts•	Log into their user accounts•	Put items up for auction, specifying a start and end date, and upload an image•	Assign products to a category, where categories are hierarchical and can contain sub-categories•	Bid on items•	Create auction groups under specific category(es), specifying the location of the group and, if desired, the radius, outside of which users will not see the group (discussed more below)•	Delete their own groups•	Join an auction group•	Establish connections with other users (similar to any other social media site)ADVANCED FUNCTIONS•	Recommendation System One advanced feature will be a recommendation system, requiring the use of machine learning algorithms.  We can use this to suggest new auctions to the user based on what groups they are a part of, the product itself, the popularity of the product, in addition to other features.  We can use a similar algorithm to recommend groups to users.  •	Search by Location The other advanced feature will allow the user to specify a ""central location"" geocoordinates of a group, if desired (this would be useful if the user wanted to create a local group, say, only for Urbana-Champaign residents). Then, any user could search for nearby groups and be presented with this list. To obtain the geocoordinates of users or groups, we will use the Google Maps API to retrieve these coordinates. They will then be stored in our database, and we can use the spherical distance formula to compute the distance between two of these geocoordinates."
31,31,1,"DescriptionThis application is a real-time data visualization tool that takes in any type of data such as, sensor data or stocks, and produces a real-time visualization model of the user’s choosing. There is also an option for predictive analysis, which finds correlation between the different data points inputted into our tool. The problem we are trying to solve is the lack of optimal real-time data visualization. Our solution is to create a seamless tool that takes in variable data inputs and presents a user friendly model with API capabilities.Usefulness•	There are existing tools made from utilities like D3.js that are able to visualize an inputed dataset. •	However, currently, there is not a similar application capable of data visualization for such a wide range of datasets, from stocks to Internet of Things. Our application is a one of a kind tool that makes viewing data simple and can adapt to any user’s needs. •	What makes us different is that there is a vast amount of data, especially with things like IoT, that do not have a clear means of communicating what the data means. Our advanced functionality solves this problem.RealnessOur data is real data fed from existing datasets (from both hardware like sensors or Nest thermostats as well as software such as Stocks APIs). It is continuous and versatile, meaning that there is a constant stream of data. The beauty of this application that essentially any data can be inputted and our application will adapt to meet the needs of the user.FunctionalityBasic FunctionA couple of basic functions include importing data, creating and managing user profiles, manipulating the database of data, and printing out data info. For the demo, we are going to simulate data from a sensor by creating a script that will generate random numbers from multiple sensors. In addition, each user will have a different database for their specific data. Once the data is imported, the user can insert, delete, or update the data (3 of the CRUD operations). The data will also be categorized by either sensor in our sensor example or by companies for the stock example.Advanced Function•	Predictive analysis - cool to have this because it can allow users to extrapolate further and use our application to make their own conclusions •	Comprehensive API support- cool to have this because it can allow us to make our product open source such that other users can modify the codebase to optimize the real-time algorithms, etc. •	Data visualization- cool to have this because there is a vast amount of data, especially with things like IoT, that do not have a clear means of communicating what the data means. Our advanced functionality solves this problem. •	Managing multiple user sessions and keeping them isolated- many apps have scenarios in which multiple users are using the site at once, but ours involves modifying a common dataset (e.g. stock data) while keeping this modification isolated to that user •	Real-Time- cool to have this because instead of taking pre-gathered data (like what D3.js or other tools do) we can optimize and render to deliver immediate results •	Hours spent implementing the above functionalities "
32,32,2,"Description:This is a dining platform that provides recommendation on dinning choices based on users’ input and preference. Users can simply input the ingredients, flavor or any type of cuisine around the world and then our site will recommend numerous dining options, including nearby restaurants and recipes, to our users. Currently, there are a bunch of dining applications and websites (e.g. Yelp) out there, however, users usually need to decide which restaurant they want to look for in advance and these sites are not able to narrow down the dining options based on the type of food users prefer. Hence, the core idea of our project is that our website will make tailored dining recommendations to our users.Usefulness:The reasoning behind our application is that sometimes people crave certain foods with certain ingredients. Though websites such as Yelp or Grubhub provide names of restaurants that have certain types of food, these websites do not go into much detail and only allow for a general type of food search. On the other hand, our application knows that people crave certain foods at certain times and so our application searches for dishes at various restaurants and provides dishes that will match a person’s cravings.Realness:The data that we need for this application will come from various sources. Menus, addresses and recipes will come from websites such as Grubhub, Yelp and even from the restaurant’s personal website as well.Functionality:•	Basic:a.	Display restaurant information/rating/comment from some dining websitesb.	Display all the recipes relevant to the user input from databasec.	Post your comment/rating/photo of the restaurant to website d.	Share your own recipe/blog to our platforme.	Insource website such as OpenTable to provide reserve functionf.	Insertion/Deletion of dishes, menus and restaurant information and updating whenever necessary to our database•	Advanced:a.	Advance search function that parses through a menu - Breaking down the ingredients of each dish and providing the most relevant dish to usersb.	Provide suggestions of dishes to the users based on their past search history and other factors (e.g. weather) with the design of some matching algorithms that reflects preferencec.

33,33,10,"1.	Description  We are going to do a very formal internship websites only for college students. Many internship websites right now are not that useful. We are going to get all the resources of top companies websites and from schools, and then post to our application. We do not invite recruiters. What we do is to set a big database for internship for students to search. Simple and clean.2.	Usefulness.   There many internship websites in the market right now, and most of them are complicated and do not have a focus. Many universities also have their own career service, however, in our application, we are only a big search engine and a useful platform for college students to find internship. It is simple and efficient. We manipulate our methods of computing and data collecting to gather as many internships as possible to put on the websites to let students to search with a simple search. There are no fancy and complicated structure, but just all the information for internships.3.	Realness.   We will have company names and the positions each company provides as our data. User information is also a part of the data. We will crawl the position information from the webpages of the companies.4.	Description of the functionality. a.	Basic Functions: i.	Position Lists: The webpage crawls top 50 companies from different fields occasionally and lists the real-time open positions (outdated positions will be deleted from the database).ii.	Sign-up/ Sign-in: User will be recommended to register first so that the webpage’s advanced function can better work for the user. There will be two ways for the user to fill in the registration form: he can either type in the information manually; or upload his resume and check the autofill from his parsed resume. (The webpage will provide parse and autofill function.) The user is welcome to re-upload a new resume, edit or delete his information later.iii.	Favorite Positions: User can bookmark/unbookmark his interested/favorite positions. He can check these positions as a list in his home page. He can rearrange the order of the bookmarked positions in his personal position list.b.	Advanced Functions:i.	Resume Parsing: The webpage will parse the uploaded resume and autofill the registration form for the user so that the user doesn’t have to type in the registration form (usually long) by himself.ii.	Job matching: The webpage will search the data base and match the user with his suitable positions. The match will use the information such as major, interest, past experiences, fluency level of skills, etc as references.iii.	Job search engine: This function is similar to the previous one but this function enables interaction from users. User can type in any key words and the engine will search the most relevant result for the user (just like a normal search engine, but only job positions will be listed)."
34,34,9,"1.	Project Title: Gaming Buddy Finder 2.	Project Summary: We hope to build a platform that allows gamers to quickly find like minded people to game with. a.	Description: We want to build a web application takes in user information via manual input and also by connecting with their game profiles in order to match gamers with others based on interests, skill level, location, etc.   b.	Usefulness: People nowadays are feeling depressed and games are often their only option to escape reality. By using our platform, we offer a user friendly yet useful network to link between gamers to promote relationships. It will be useful for busy, lonely people, whether they are students, businessmen or what-not who have no time to build large communities of people to game with, a chance to interact with people. Our platform aims to provide a quick match between users to play games of their favorite, and possibly build a feedback system on the users of their friendliness, helpfulness on games, or other features. Our platform is different from existing platforms because other apps generally provide a list of players based on a very broad search so the user has to do most of the work going through all the profiles and find a good fit. Our recommendation system will do this work for the user and provide a quicker, less frustrating experience.   c.	Realness: We will be getting data from users. The data will input their interests on the genres of the games, the platform of the game the user uses, the skills of the users, and the user profiles. The profiles will include the languages, the ages, gender and similar interest outside of games so that when users become friends they can have common interests that will promote the relationship. We will also pull statistics from various websites such as Steam to add on to the profiles.   d.	Description of the functionality that you plan to offer.i.	Basic Functions: The basic functions will be adding user profiles and inputting appropriate data. Also, we'll have player circles, a review system to give feedback on who was fun to play with, and  ii.	Advanced Functions:1.	We will have a recommendation system to suggest matching players using a decision tree. 2.	We will add on to profiles by connecting accounts with platforms like Steam and retrieve necessary information from online sources to enhance user profiles. "
35,35,3,"Description The website aims to give students a place where they can post questions about a course or look at how difficult a course is. Existing solutions include facebook pages (like Easy Classes UIUC etc.) but the information is pretty cluttered. Illini Classes would be a unified information base with reviews, course description and student concerns making it easier for students to decide which course to take. Usefulness Illini Classes will be useful since it is a combined database of information about courses. There are existing websites like rateMyProf which solely focus on reviews about professors. We provide students a place to review the course, the professor, rate the course and provide information about average course load. The students can also ask questions about courses, removing the need for intermediate websited like reddit to ask questions about courses. RealnessThe API provided by UIUC will be used to get the data regarding the courses, faculty and the departments offering the course. Example:http://courses.illinois.edu/cisapp/explorer/catalog/2017/spring.xml Other pieces of data will include user information, course information, reviews, and question and answers. The questions and answers will exist in a forum for each specific course, and reviews will be separate from the question and answers.  Course information will contain data about average course load (in terms of time), and a basic summary of what the class teaches. User info will contain (for now) just the username, password, and email.  Description of the functionality that you plan to offer.1.	Basic Functions: The data that we store in our database are of two types. The details regarding the departments, courses and staff will be obtained from the API provided by UIUC. While the reviews and ratings regarding the professors will be obtained from real users who use the system •	Users create an account giving basic details.Users can write new reviews, edit and delete them. There will be two access levels, users and another for moderators. •	In addition the website provides a search functionality for the users to search for a specific course using the course ID or name. 1.	Advanced Functions: •	Forum: students can ask questions about courses and get answered by other students or instructors •	Word filtering to filter out or change inappropriate words. Use NLP to see what students say the most about a certain course to give an aggregated review about a course. "

It also provides listeners the chance to broaden their musical libraries with unique songs that the mainstream industry does not create.  Realness: We are looking into the Soundcloud API or using a web-crawler in order to retrieve the necessary data (i.e date posted, number of views, like/dislike ratio, etc). We will also incorporate user data in the form of user voting. This will be used to adjust our algorithm in order to better recommend music to a individual user's tastes. Description of Functionality:•	Basic •	Real Data:•	Soundcloud API Tracks•	User Profiles•	 Insert,Update,Delete•	 Search the database, List or Print returned results•	Advanced •	Promotion of Artists•	Music Suggestions based on User Voting•	Commenting On Songs (not supported by current database design)"
37,37,10,"Title:College helperSummary College helper provides various tools for students to manage their academic life.DescriptionCollege helper is a website which helps UIUC students who major in CS, ECE and ECON to schedule classes and to communicate with other students who have same class.Firstly, every student has to decide what they will take next semester. Sometimes this is a pretty difficult job. Suppose one student has a tough semester so that he cannot spare the time to meet his academic advisor. In this case, he needs to check several websites to list future classes and this is a cumbersome process. But with College helper, this job can be done easily. We offer easy managing of a student's academic life. Depending on major, standing and interest, students can get a best-fit of their class schedule. Also they can track their GPA and academic progress which indicates remaining credits and requisite courses to graduation.Secondly, we offer a forum for students who want to find a study-group or share an opinion about a certain class. Many classes use Piazza to ask a question or have a discussion but after finishing the semester, the Piazza system is no longer was managed by anyone,so it is really hard to get useful information for a student who wants to take that class in the future. As soon as a user adds a course to his course timeline, he automatically joins the registered class forum and he can see past discussions, look for study groups easily and use this website as his secondary tool for future classes.UsefulnessCollege helper is useful in two ways. Firstly, they can easily manage their academic work. There are several websites that offer this functionality. Namely, UIUC enterprise, compass 2G and moodle. But the functionality is spread out over these websites. For example, we can see GPA, earned credits, and standing but there is no way we can find a best-fit schedule depending on several factors like preference and major. So it will be absolutely useful if student can use such a system. College helper aims to bring the functionality of all these websites to one place.There is also no centralized source where a student can find opinions and discussions about classes from past students. There are several websites that provide similar information  like ratemyprofessor.com or koofers.com. But often times, they only show student’s opinion about the professor and not the class itself. College helper offers a simple forum where a student can easily find and interact with students who have taken the course before.RealnessGenerally, we have two data sets: one for the course timeline and other for forum.For the forum, as posts are made by users, we will be storing the threads, comments, user information, date/time of post and which thread each comment was posted in. This data will accumulate as the website is used. There is no initial data.For managing system, we need student’s academic records and information of classes. First of all, user will type basic information like his GPA, taken classes and standing when they sign up to the website. Data about the class will come from each department websites and course catalog provided by UIUC office of registrar. After gathering data, we will combine the information and make a more interactive and comprehensive databaseDescription of functionalityBasic Functions: Add,  remove and view courses from the course timeline. Courses will have all the relevant course information like credit hours, professor, etc. Each course will be assigned a difficulty based on the average grade of students from past semesters. The website will basically be like a combination of DARS and the course catalog. The website will also offer information about core course requirements for graduation depending on the user’s major. Each user will be able to login and view/edit their course timeline and plan out their four years in college.Advanced Functions:We plan to offer an autofill function where depending on the user’s major, we will display a completely filled timeline that would show when the user should take each course over their 4 years. This would require a combination of information about what each major’s core courses are and in what order they need to be taken and how they can all be spread out over the 8 available semesters. This feature can help new students get an idea of what their college timeline should look like and they have some kind of default timeline to begin with which they can then edit according to their preferences.We also plan to offer a forum/message board where students of the same major can communicate. Each major would have their own message board where users can post comments and discuss various things or ask for help if they need it. We can add further complexity by adding tags to comments and then letting users search for comments that only relate to a particular class that they are interested in.  "
38,38,0,"Description: Right now, dating applications are very superficial, with people selecting potential mates based on physical features. We aim to overcome this problem with modern day dating by connecting people through more substantial interests - books! Booking Up is an application that matches people up based on similarities in their reading tastes. Users input their personal information and their interests, like favorite books, authors, and genres, and an algorithm will present them with a list of potential matches that they share similarities with. The user is then free to start conversation with a match if both have expressed interest in the other.Usefulness: There are plenty of dating sites already available such as Tinder and Bumble. Our application is unique because it connects people based on their readings interests over something more superficial. Our application is useful because it caters to the crowd who are looking for a meaningful relationship that they aren’t able to find on available dating platforms and allows them to form connections based on something more significant. Realness: Our book related data such as authors, genres, and book titles will come from web-scraping Goodreads while the rest of the data will be user generated.Basic Functions: 1.	For the initial choice of books that users can select, we will be write an automated web-scraper that will select the 100 most popular books. In addition, we will have 10+ developed accounts, of users, who will potentially be matched.2.	Some possible examples of inserting will be adding to new users to the application and updating will be change the user’s book preferences and characteristics.3.	The interesting queries would be joining the book and user tables  in order to join users that like the same book or similar genres of books for potential dates and we will be able to print potential joins. Another potential query is creating a table that would contain all the information on the books that a user has liked.Advanced Functions:1.	In order to connect people with others who best match their reading interests, we’ll be implementing a ranking algorithm. This will sort people into a list with those who have very similar interests, like a particular book, in the beginning and less specific interests, like a common genre, towards the end.2.	We will also be implementing a feature that allows users to see which book, genre, and author led them to the most “successes”, with success being defined as conversation initiated after a match."
39,39,0,"1: Description  of an application of your choice. State as clearly as possible what you want to do. What problem do you solve and etc? A:The project should be able to track daily prices (lowest)  of merchandise from some popular website, such as hotel, tickets on Expedia, items on Amazon.And use the collected price information to plot graphs. The graph will help users know the price vs. time better.  Or analysis like min, max, mean, percentilewill be use instead of the graph.For instance, if I saw a $1000 $100 deal on Bestbuy, I may wonder it that good? And I will look it up on Price Tracker and probably find out that it was actually$120 all the time and the labeled priced was deceptive. Or I may find out that an item has reached a historical low and purchase it instantly.  And fortraveling, it could tell me how much money exactly I can save if I avoid the popular season. It should be able to help users know the more genuine price.2: Usefulness.  State as clearly as possible why your chosen application is useful.  Make sure to answer the following questions: Are there any similaror equivalent web sites/applications out here?  If so, what are they and how is yours different? B: I don’t know any similar websites. And the usefulness is stated in the previous section.3: Realness.  Describe what your data is and where you will get it. C: The only useful data is the price. And it will be collected from popular shopping websites like Amazon, Bestbuy, etc and booking website like Expedia, Hotel, etc.4:Description of the functionality that you plan to offer. This is where you talk about how to meet the advanced functionality requirements.  There are twotypes of functions you need to offer: D: Basic function will be searched and modify the data.The advanced function will add the item and fetch the price from a website.Add item: Input should be Item name and a link to the source. And the item on the website should be able to start to update itself. 1. Fetch: Should be able to fetch the price at the certain frequency from the source website.I think easy to add the item and able to update itself it the key to this project.Because that will make tracking more items possible. If documenting item prices has to be done manually, it will be impossible to track a large number of items.2.We will implement a advanced function which is a ""price prediction"". It can both help customers to determine if it is a good choice to buy the product at that time. It can also help merchants to give an appropriate price of the products."
40,40,10,"DescriptionOur application allows UIUC students to upload and view past ECE/CS course materials, specifically with the intent of past exams and homework assignments.  Students will be able to upload their old documents from classes they have taken and view other documents that their peers have uploaded.  Documents will also be automatically uploaded by our crawler (see Advanced Functions below).  There will be a rating system where students can rate the quality of the exams (and solutions if present).  Higher-rated exams will be displayed to users before lower-rated ones.  Once an exam receives so many low ratings, it will be automatically removed.This will be particularly useful if you are in a class which does not post practice exams or which posts practice exams for only one or two past semesters.  Students will also be able to search for exams by particular professors (in conjunction with the University Registrar's API), documents from a specific course, or from a specific semester (if applicable). UsefulnessOur application is useful because it allows students to study for their exams and learn material more easily.  Oftentimes in courses from semester to semester, past exams will be lost when course websites are torn down or professors will not have access to past exams, so students have trouble finding study material.  We aim to solve this problem.We are unique because we specifically target UIUC ECE/CS courses, and we are a free service.  Other websites (like CourseHero or Chegg) are for any class at any university, and they often charge students to view material.  Our only ""fee"" is other UIUC students uploading their exams, thereby creating a mutually helpful environment.  Also, unlike CourseHero, we are plugging directly into the University Registrar database to obtain courses and professors associated with them each semester.  This allows students to better pinpoint which exams will be most useful for them to review. Furthermore, our crawler and attempt to automatically flag documents separates us from CourseHero is purely driven by user input.RealnessWe intend to obtain our documents in two ways:  (1) user input, and (2) writing a crawler to automatically obtain exams from ECE/CS course websites.We also will use the University Registrar's API to obtain which professors taught courses each semester.FunctionalityBasic Functions1.	The real data will be obtained from both users and crawling (as described in the Realness section above).2.	Insert:  Will occur when a user uploads a new document. Update:  Will occur when a document receives a new rating from users. Delete:  Will occur when a low-rated document is removed from the system automatically or when an administrator removes a document manually.3.	Searching the database will occur when students search for a particular exam.  For instance, they may want the exams of ECE 210 in semesters where Lara Waldrop was a professor.  This will involve a join of our professors and documents tables.Advanced Functions1.	PDF Verifier:  When a student uploads an document, verify that the PDF uploaded has a high likelihood of indeed being an exam.  For instance, we will ensure that the document is mostly text.  We will also ensure that the document is not, say, a pornographic image.  These measures will increase the overall document quality of our system.2.	Exam Crawler:  As suggested by Joey, we will build a robust crawler that automatically searches course websites (i.e. https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/ece210/sp2017/index_SP17.html) for exams and uploads them to our database.  This will increase the overall amount of material on our website and ensure that quality exams are present, possibly with solutions provided by course staff."

The prices will be displayed based on filtering decided by the user with links to the product page on original website.The application will allow users to create a profile and add other users’ profile to a friend list called “My Gang”. The user will be able to share his/her wish list with users in his/her friend list. His/her friends will be able to provide feedback (in terms of comment) on each product on the wish list.Another feature of the application will track historical data of product prices over a period of weeks and provide a predictive scoring indicating the best time to buy the time.UsefulnessThis application extracts products information from various online retail stores and provides the price information without having to browse websites individually. This not only saves users’ time but also provide a comparison tool of product prices in one page. The product selection list on the application can be also determined by certain advanced filters indicated by the user. For example:•	Products that qualify for free shipping;•	Products that are sold by the third party;•	Products that have customer reviews of greater than 4 stars.This above filtering is unique in providing the user control over search algorithm.Some online retail websites allow the sharing of wish list with friends but does not have the inbuilt facility of allowing friends share their feedback on the product shared. A friend in the “gang” can be an expert on a product and may suggest buying the same from a different brand. All feedbacks between friends can either be public or private based on user preference.Plotting minimum price of a product over a period of time can be a major advantage in the decision making process of user. From the historical plot the user can gage the time period when he/she gets the best deal on the product and plan his/her finances accordingly. The application will obtain historical data of product price by using a web crawler at certain intervals from website of retailers.RealnessProduct data will be crawled from online retail website like Amazon, Costco, Walmart, Sam's Club, Target, eBay, Jet, BestBuy, Kohls, Macy's, JcPenny and Sears. User data will be generated manually by users accessing the application.Basic Functions1.	User can access the application as a guest. Data about the product prices will be crawled based on user search criteria mentioned above under Usefulness section.2.	Inserting records will occur when users create their account and when users create wish list. Last five products searched by a user will be recorded in the database and will be displayed when the user logs back in.3.	Updating records will occur when users send link up request with other users and share wish list and when the application crawls new data about product prices.4.	Users’ accounts and wish list can be updated or deleted from time to time.Advanced Functions1.	Social Media and Recommendations:  Friends in the user’s friend list can provide feedback on each product in the wish list. Feedbacks will be inserted into the database. The feedback can either be private or public based on the feedback providers’ preferences. We will also show a recommended list of friends and items one can buy.2.	Historical Data: Web crawler will run periodically to save pricing data of various products to the database. The user will be able to pull out the historical price of saved products over a certain period of time. The price tracker will also provide a predictive score which will help determine the best time to buy the products. "

43,43,4,"DescriptionAn application that allows users to geotag events and classified ads overlaid onto a map of the surrounding location. By default the application uses the current location however the user can do this by dropping a tag onto a particular location on the map.This would allow them to see the different events and advertisements around the tag.The users can create events in our application, we will be storing this information onto our database. We would use the past events information, to create a heat map which shows the most popular locations for events. Additionally, we will be creating a feature to recommend events to the user and we will allow users to pay for the cover fees or products directly through the application.The users will be able to locate the events that their friends are attending. They can also filter events based on time periods, group sizes and specific event categories. UsefulnessThe following applications have features which are similar to ours:1.	Meet up2.	Craigslist3.	Facebook4.	Venmo /PaypalWhat sets our project apart from the applications listed above is that our application will combine the best features of everything listed above. Also it will add a unique and novel map overlay, which will make finding events and classifieds easier than ever before. Additionally, the event suggestion, friend finder and heat map provides functionality that nothing else does.The popularity of specific of location is a valuable data, which many companies would like to have access. RealnessThe user data, their name, id and friend list will be derived from facebook. We will also be using the facebook to log into the application. The user will be able to input their own personal information. The past hosted events and user ratings will be taken from the events created in the application and the users who attended them. For the events and classified, ids will be autogenerated within the application, to provide a unique number. The description, start times, end times, names, locations, max group sizes and fees will be inputted by the user. The map will be taken from the google maps api, we will only be using this to generate the map. We store our own coordinates for the events, and we will be developing an algorithm to fence off specific locations in order to specify where they are bound within the map. We will determine the popularity of the location based on some algorithm which will use the past events data as well as friends that would have visited at those locations in the past. FunctionsBasic Functions▪	Create Events▪	Update Personal Description▪	Filter Events on Map▪	Attend Event▪	Closing off events past max group size▪	Review event host▪	Pay for event or product feeAdvanced Functions▪	Fencing off specific locations: ▪	Determining general terms that people use ""the quad"" , ""south field"" that are not necessarily bounded by specific coordinates.▪	This will make it easier to locate the events and determine the popularity of specific locations▪	Generating a heat map for location popularity▪	This is a data visualisation method, which will nicely determine where other users tend to host events in certain cities or campuses▪	It would be great for universities or property owners to advertise, for example, the engineering quad may be UIUC's most popular event location▪	Suggesting events for users▪	This will be a useful as it will make selecting events for users significantly easier"
44,44,5,"•	Description Crossroads is a website where open source project maintainers/owners can list their projects to help find contributors. We want to make it easier for developers to find projects that they can join and help grow the open source community by increasing project discoverability.  While we believe our site can be helpful to anyone wanting to participate in open source, people who participate in open source voluntarily will likely benefit the most as we will be recommending new projects to users based on their interests. Rather than hosting the repositorites ourselves, the goal will be to list any OSS project so that people are able to see the wide range of projects and software that exists and make it easy to find something new to work on.  •	Usefulness Discoverability is not a major focus of major repository sites like GitHub. Open source relies on having contributors able to join and help develop projects. Github explore is a basic system that GitHub has to try and allow developers to find new and interesting projects. Our goal is to be a location that developers can use to quickly find something interesting, with a focus on displaying key metrics up front that developers that are looking for a project want to see.  •	Realness When users add a new repository to our website, they can provide a GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket repo link, and we will pull data about that repository and display that data on our websites, allowing other users to view all of the data without having to go directly to the repository.  If the project is self-hosted or hosted somewhere else, we will allow the submitter to provide their own data about the repository which will be displayed.  We will also get the top 100 repositories in terms of open source contribution from Github and GitLab so that our users will have a base of repositories to browse.  •	Functionality Basic functions1.	Add Projects: Project owners can add projects to our website by providing a name, description, and link to the github or Bitbucket page of the project.2.	Update Projects: Project owners can change the data of projects that they have added to our website.3.	Search Projects: Users can search projects through name, tag, topic, platform, and language4.	Filter Projects: In their account page, there will be a list of options which will change what the user sees.  For example, there will be a languages box, and a user could choose to only see Ruby projects.  Users will be able to filter by programming language, platform, and other broad categories.5.	Tag Projects:  Users can add tags that they think appropriately describe a project.  If a tag exists in the database already, it's rating attribute is incremented indicating that it is now a more relevant description of the project.  If the tag does not exist, it will be added to the Tags table.6.	View Project History: Each user will be able to view projects that they own as well as projects that they have contributed to in the past or are currently contributing to.•	Advanced Functionality1.	Finding Similiar Projects: We will have a ""project feed"", which is each user's home page, consisting of new projects and projects that the user has been matched with. We will use our tagging system to help us do this.  We will use the user's project history to help determine new projects that they might be interested in joining.2.	Matching Projects with coders: This will be done by having each user fill out a form on account creation, where they will answer questions about themselves so that we can match them, using some algorithm, to projects that we have on our website.  This will be done only on account creation.  Our algorithm will be related to the algorithms employed by dating websites to match users to other users.  This will involve putting the tags into a matrix and using the least-squares solution to determine the projects that have attributes that match closely with the users' interests."
45,45,2,"a.	Description Our website stores movies' information by crawling from various movie rating website. We will let user search, make reviews on and like movies. Sometimes, viewers cannot find new movies that they like. Our website solve this problem by letting users like movies ,and suggestions will be  generated based on users' likes.b.	Usefulness We want to make a movie website which can not only let you rate and search, but also gives you accurate suggestion based on the movies that you liked by implement machine learning. IMDB is a similar website while it doesn't give suggestion or notification.c.	Realness Our entity sets are movie, actor, director, user and review. Movie have name, year, rating and have multiple subclasses like romance and action. For movie information, we will crawl current movie websites like IMDB and rotten tomato. User data will be input by users. Review will be made by users and append to movies. Director and actor data will be crawled from movie websites like IMDB and linked to Wikipedia.d.	Description of the functionality that you plan to offeri.	Basic Functions:  (1) Crawling data from other website   (2) User can make review and we will Insert/delete/update  (3) Given the search constraints, conduct basic query that searches the database and list or print the returned records. ii.	Advanced Functions: (1) Based on users' preference history, it give smart suggestion of similar movies using machine learning algorithm. (2) Web crawling different websites and integrate data by connecting duplicate records.  (3) Based on users' preference, find similar future released movies and send email notification before the premiere. iii.iv."
46,46,2,"Project descriptionREFERENCES is a website for users to manage and find good papers to cite. Except basic query can be achieved on this website, this website can give the recommendation based on the user personalization. Unlike the Google Scholar ""pull mode"" website, the REFERENCES is more likely a ""push mode"" website.UsefulnessTo help users finding high-quality papers in their research areas. Easy for users managing their downloaded and published papers. There are several website similar to ours such as Google Scholar, but our advantage compare to them is simplicity. We don't have detail content from the paper, but just basic information, which is easier for users to go over and find the paper that they are looking for instead of reading a bunch of useless paragraphs that doesn't related to what they want. We also rank the paper by its quality unlike Google Scholar, the detail is in the description of advanced functionality.RealnessThe data we have used in our database are from DBLP and https://aminer.org/, which we wrote a program in python that can capture all the basic information appears in these two website, such as user, venue, date, etc.Functionality (basic)Insert user or favorite paper:•	Insert data in the registration page•	Add paper that user select to his favorite paper listSearch Paper:•	Search by Journal•	Search by Conference•	Search by Author•	Search by YearUpdate:•	After a user adding a paper to his list, a heart symbol will appear instead of “+” symbol, and the number next to “Cart” will update to the new number of papers that currently in user’s list. When user go to his list, he will see the paper he just added is already in the list. User can delete the paper from his list and that paper will not appear in his list.Delete:•	User can delete the paper from his list and that paper will not appear in his list.Functionality (advanced)1 RECOMMENDATION SYSTEMThe recommendation system we plan to provided with the following feature:•	Get recommendation of the papers that liked by the users who also like the papers added by you.Question: Get the title of papers that liked by the users like the paper you added (e.g. your userID = ''12345).SELETC paperIDFROM FavoriteWHERE userID IN(SELECT f2.userIDFROM Favorite f1, Favorite f2WHERE f1.userID = '12345' AND f1.userID = f2.userID);•	Get recommendation of authors have the similar research interests and research reputation.Question: Get the name of the authors with same research area.

47,47,4,"Description of application:- Our application will be a website for people to organize group-based events. Users will be able to create and modify events, set up groups, create projects, designate tasks, and network with other members of specified roles in order to participate. Usefulness:- It will be useful to streamline and simplify the process of searching for and gathering groups of similar skills. This will primarily be useful for Undergraduate and Graduate students who are looking to join, form, or manage teams for classes or events that they want to participate in, such as hackathons or engineering design competitions. Project management applications like Trello and Asana can help you manage a team and organize your project but are only useful once you actually have a team in place. This application will help you find the ideal team and then give you the tools to manage it. Realness:- The data will be almost all user-inputted. Users will register and be able to create and set up groups, and organize events if they have permission/clearance to do so. There will be some auxiliary data created and used by the advanced function as well, which will also probably be stored in the database. Basic Functions:- Keeps track of users and their various statistics – skills, past projects/teams, past events, friends/associates, experience level, overall rating- Users can create and maintain events, as well as specify various requirements about participation.- These events can have various effects on participating groups and users. For example, earning a notable mention from one of these events might leave a record on the group and their users. This may be listed under achievements by a user and can improve their overall rating.- Users can create groups to target these various events, and after that, users can add, modify, and remove others from their groups. Users will also be able to assign tasks to their team members and designate specific roles for team members.- The main part of the application ties into this: Users will be able to streamline this group formation process and make it easier to create well-balanced and compatible teams. For example, if a group needs a UI designer, the user will be able to search for all UI-designer-tagged users in the database. Advanced Features:Advanced Feature 1: Intelligent analysis based on gathered user and event statistics.- As users and their formed groups participate in more and more events and gather recognition, the application will be able to assign various statistics to those users in order to form and identify trends. Using those statistics, the application should be able to analyze the user's capabilities and compatibility in order to recommend the user into certain events, certain groups, or perhaps even to restrict a user out of certain events.- Example 1: A user has been consistently rated low by a particular group of people after working within their group. The system should recognize this and dissuade the user from joining similar groups in the future.- Example 2: A user creates an event. He will be able to specify a certain skill bracket and restrict higher-skilled users from participating in such events, in order to create a more standardized and fair competition. Advanced Feature 2: Various intricate visualizations of a user's statistics, so that the user can intuitively understand his own capabilities. It will be implemented in pure HTML5/JavaScript.- As we're gathering more and more information about a user, we would have a page where a user can see his own (or maybe others, with permission) data organized and laid out in a pleasing, easy-to-understand manner. By doing this, the application may even reveal certain traits or skills that the user would have previously been unaware of about himself."
48,48,0,"Description: We intend to create an online textbook service where students at our university can type in their class codes and find out the textbook they need for that class. Offers from other websites (UIbookstore, Amazon, eBay, Chegg and Facebook) will also be available so users can compare prices and find their best option. We will provide the URL for each offer so they can go to the website they are interested in and make purchases. Moreover, users can also put in information of the books they want to sell and make offers at our service. Prices from different dealers will also be available to help them decide how much they shall set the price.This service solves the problem students have when looking for cheaper options of textbooks. Since there is few website that has integrated resources, students always have to go to various websites and make a lot of searches to find the book they want, while worrying about whether they get the right book or edition. In order to solve this problem, our service will link the book information from the bookstore website to other dealers, and show all corresponding information in one search. Usefulness: This will be a very useful service because it solves the problem mentioned above and makes the book searching experience much easier for students. Besides, since it integrates offers from both other websites and individual sellers on Facebook, it also maximizes the chance students find an optimal deal, which will make it welcome in the user group.There is almost no similar service around based on our research. UIbookstore website offers the “compare price” function, however, there is always no result or very limited information shown for textbook searches. All other websites only provide book and price information without corresponding classes or universities related to it. So our service will be unique by combining class and textbook, and offer information. Realness: We will get our data from different book websites. On one side, we will crawl data from UI bookstore website, where we can get class and corresponding textbook information. On the other side, we will crawl data from Amazon, eBay and Chegg for related books, prices and URLs. We will also get data from Facebook textbook and exchange group (if possible) to get individual offers and their contact information. Functionality:Basic functions:(1) We will crawl data from the four sites to build a database as mentioned above.(2) Moreover, we will also allow users to enter their own data when they create accounts. The accounts will be updated with their book research and purchase history.Advanced:(1) Parsing data from the four websites to our system automatically.This will be very useful to our service because the offers at other websites or of individual sellers are constantly changing, and we want our user to have the most updated information. Also, the availability of individual offers are updating fast, so it is important for us to give them the correct information(2) Giving time recommendations and price forecasts based on the price trend in historical data.This will be cool because through the analysis of historical data, we can give users recommendations of when is the best time to make purchases and help them save money. If prices always go down after a week school starts, it will be helpful to let the users know so that they can have a better deal."
49,49,3,"DescriptionOpen Classroom will be a web application that aims to encourage students to ask questions and communicate with their professor and classmates anonymously. If a student is feeling apprehensive about raising their hand and asking questions in a large class, Open Classroom will take that apprehension away. This application will provide a platform for students to ask and vote on questions for their professor to receive during a lecture or review session. It will give professors the ability to poll students on questions, and provide data and feedback from past questions or years. UsefulnessThis application is useful because it provides an integration of the functionality of i-clicker or similar devices, as well as class forums such as piazza, but for live questioning. Our idea is different than other applications which share some functionality, because it works to provide interaction between the class and the lecturer in multiple ways, as well as making use of past data or questions to improve the class experience.RealnessThe data will be created by each class session that uses the application. The data is the questions, and the polling results.FunctionalityBasic Functions1.	Provide anonymity to students, not to professor.2.	Rating system for questions.3.	Store data by each class session.4.	Login through university account.Advanced Functions1.	Retrieve past class session data from a filterable search engine. 2.	Stats for in class questions. "
50,50,10,"a.DescriptionOur project is to build an online platform for second-hand goods trading, house subleasing ,ride services and courses tutoring. Currently, our target users are university students. Every user needs to register by their school emails. Through our platform, users could post tasks or take tasks from others. Once you accomplish posted tasks, you will receive corresponding money reward. Similarly if your tasks are solved by other users, you need to pay a certain amount of money. Primarily we focus on following types of tasks. Ride services for students who don’t have their own cars but need rides (preferred long-distance). Tutoring services for students seeking tutors about specific courses. Proofreading for academic writing or application essay review. Second-hand goods and house subleasing trading. Via our website, each user could access resources beyond their social networks. b.UsefulnessWe think our application is useful since we realize that at most of time, people are confined by their social networks while encountering some problems. Our application provides a platform for users to break the restrictions from their own social networks and receive helps from outsides. Most prevailed social network applications don’t have any confine on their user selection. Everyone could have an account or even some of them have multiple accounts. This situations enormously decrease user’s credit standing. The difference between our program and others is that we specifically target on university students. Only school emails would be legit to sign up on our website. By this means, we could filter frauds and vicious users at large extent. Besides, we categorize the types of tasks posted on our website in order to accelerate the efficiency. c.RealnessRealness: Our data contains the personal information (username, password, email-address, sns account) of users, the information of tasks (title, type, post time, solved, user), etc that people post online. So in general the data will be primarily based on the input of our users.d.DescriptionBasic functions:1.	Our data comes from real user inputs such as the user information and task information. 2.	When user posts a task or creates an account, we will add a tuple in the corresponding table (insert). When user edits the task or edit his/her user information, we will update the tuple in the table (update). When user deletes his/her post, the corresponding tuple will be deleted. 3.	Users can search by category or simply search the key word. Advanced functions:      1. Spam detector to filter out inappropriate tasks by some ""spam words"" with classifiers like Naive Bayes.       2. For second hand trading, we will show similar items to users using machine learning algorithms such as clustering.       3. Notify user through email if something they were looking for is on the task board according to the searching history of the user.  "
51,51,2,"1.	Description of an application of your choice. State as clearly as possible what you want to do. What problem do you solve and etc?  Our app will give recommendations based on people's criteria: from price range to type of food, and also based on if they want to go to the restaurants they have been to or not. Another feature that we're gonna implement is generating random restaurants. This app is going to be useful for those people who just can't decide where to eat.    2.	Usefulness.  State as clearly as possible why your chosen application is useful.  Make sure to answer the following questions: Are there any similar or equivalent web sites/applications out here?  If so, what are they and how is yours different?  A similar site/application is Yelp. Our application is different with Yelp because we allow users to create a list of the restaurants they have been to and let them choose which restaurant they want to go. Another feature that we're gonna implement is generating random restaurants.   3.	Realness.  Describe what your data is and where you will get it.  Our data will be restaurants and user location. We're not gonna scrap data from Yelp or Google, but we're gonna get it from restaurant databases, e.g. Factual.   4.	Description of the functionality that you plan to offer. This is where you talk about how to meet the advanced functionality requirements.  There are two types of functions you need to offer: a.	Basic Functions: see Stage 5 for what kind of basic functions you need to offer.  b.	Advanced Functions: i.	We will keep track of previously accessed restaurants and have users rate their experiences at those restaurants. Using that data we will adjust our suggestion algorithm based on certain criteria (The rating they gave, the specific tags that the restaurant has such as Chinese or Mexican food etc). Using this we will be able to suggest new restaurants that are based on their previous tastes and preferences ii.	In addition, we will allow users to log in and create an account storing their previous accessed restaurants. Furthermore, they will be able to access their own and other friend's accounts to accommodate for and adjust to other people's tastes. This would be useful for situations where you have a group of people and are unsure of what restaurant would best accommodate everyone's tastes.   5.	Create a page with the title ""ER Design"" on your project page and link it under Documents. In ""ER Design"", you should have the ER diagram for your application, plus descriptions in plain words on the assumptions you make. For example, ""we think that there must be only 1 adviser for each student"".  For our ER Design diagram, we have concluded that we would need four main entity sets (e.g. Restaurants, Food, Customer, and History) and each of them hold its own unique attributes. Restaurants have attributes that consist of Name, Address, Phone Number, and Type. We believe that Name and Address are the two keys that could identify a uniquely identifiable entities which is Restaurants. Food have attributes that consist of Price, Name, Type, and Rating. We believe that the attribute Name is the key that could identify the entity Food. We also think that Food has a relationship of at most one to Restaurant. Meanwhile, Customer have the attributes of Email, Username, Password, Condition and Email and Username as the keys of the entity set. We think that Restaurant and Customer has the relationship of many to many since multiple customers could have the same relation to the Restaurants and vice versa. The last entity sets, History, consist of (Time and Date) and Restaurant Name.  We think that History has the relation of at most one with Customers.  "
52,52,5,"Description: A website that will track the progress of construction projects and relate this to the productivity of the crew that is working on the project and the safety of the crew. We will use schedule of the construction projects as our basis and correlate each task in the project to crew productivity and safety.Usefulness: There is nothing on the market like our project. This database will serve to give a much more complete view of the overall details involved in a construction project and help to give some concrete data to the relationship between productivity and safety.Realness: The entire project will be based on actual figures found from real projects. The activity task will be updated from project schedules. The task and crew productivity will be from Weekly Productivity Reports that companies file. The safety records will be monitored through reports filed by superintendents who inspect the sites. All these records are already available, as the team has access to the information stores by Real-Time and Automated Monitoring and Control Lab.Description of the functionality: Aside from the ability to update the database and query through the information, especially the ability to perform multiple joins. We also offer the ability to find safety monitoring  information based on location, time period, and productivity. This will allow us to isolate the effect of each of these attribute and observe each respective influence. Our project will also have the ability to compare the effects of productivity on safety.  This comparison will allow users to see the actual relationships between these two entities.Moreover the website will contain the ability to create regression model of the safety conditions based on productivity. This would be extremely practical in the construction industry because while safety monitoring is difficult and expensive, productivity data is easily gathered. The ability to create relevant regression models of safety conditions would bring immediate attentions to areas of concern.In addition, we want to create anomaly detection to find outliers in our data, so we can further enhance our data and make correction to our record.  The goal is to fine tune the data and bring forward more relevant patterns that we can model our information on.  A website like this will be extremely valuable, because safety is always a major concern in the construction industry. Countless amount of money are spent to settle lawsuits and prevent injury. The feature offered by our website will allow people to see the impacts that different work conditions have on site safety. Of course, there are many preconceived notions of hazard prevention, but the website will allow users a much easier way to access relevant information."
53,53,10,"A. We would like to provide a web application that allows incoming students to find a compatible roommate. Our application will be two-fold in this respect. Students will be able to search for roommates based on certain traits and responses to certain questions, and we will also algorithmically determine, based on research, potential roommates who are likely to be a good match for them. We'll use an extensive question set to determine as many attributes and characteristics of the students as we can, so as to be as informed as possible about their personalities and interests, giving us a great chance of providing them good recommendations for roommates.We would match potential roommates based off a variety of attributes such as hobbies, major, year, and personal preferences. We would also select a suitable dormitory for the pair, and recommend potential interesting RSOs.B.      Currently, incoming students find a roommate in one of following 3 ways:1.	They know someone before they get here and choose to room with them.2.	They post in the UIUC Class Of 20xx Facebook page, describing themselves and what they are looking for in a roommate. 3.	They get randomly assigned a roommate via the university's housing pairs systems.      We aim to provide a service that does the job of 2 and 3 above more effectively and with a higher success rate for quality roommate relationships. 2 (above) is a very ineffective method of finding a roommate. Most people who post on these Facebook pages give the same boring description as everyone else does. They describe themselves vaguely with the words they think everyone else wants them to hear. 3 (above) is ineffective because the university's questionnaire is so small and meaningless. It only provides about 7 questions and most of these are very generic and don't paint a picture of who the people really are. Students are matched up based on this questionnaire, and in our experience, it does a terrible job of pairing people up. Our expanded questionnaire and more intensive algorithmic approach to pairing up roommates should easily provide more effective pairs for students than the aforementioned methods. We believe as students at the university, we have a real insight into unique aspects of our campus that can inform us about what makes a good roommate pair. C. Our data will come from real UIUC students who roomed with each other in the dorms. We feel we should be able to get a large enough sample to gather meaningful statistics and correlations for roommates. If we feel this is not enough data, we will use some randomly generated data from the normal distribution on certain traits based on research about things like the percentage of college aged students who smoke, drink, etc. We'll research these statistics for all the questions we have the students answering should we use randomly generated data. D.i. Basic Functionalities:1.	Users can sign up with their netID and password and create a profile with our provided questionnaire. 2.	Users can search on specific attributes they're looking for in a roommate, and we'll display other students who match their criterion. 3.	Users will be allowed to update and delete their accounts. 4.	Users will be provided information about these potential roommates, and they'll be able to contact them, visit their social media pages, learn more about them, etc. ii. Advanced Functionalities:    1. We will allow the user to prioritize the categories of attributes that mean the most to them in a roommate. For instance, if they care the most about sociability, we will allow them to check that and we will turn the roommates who are most similar to them socially, or meet some criteria that they give us. This allows the user to be in full control based on what their needs are. This goes far beyond any feature that's currently available via Facebook or the university system. The difficulty in implementing this advanced function is that we'll actually need scripts to general the SQL that will be called to display their given results, since the possible choices for searching they could make are very complex.     2. We will algorithmically provide the best matches for every given user. We will be doing research on the most highly correlated questions for good roommate pairs and designing an effective algorithm for picking a good pair. This will involve a high level of statistical research and development of an algorithm that needs to accomplish a task without unnecessary biases that could be harmful. This function will also likely require some scripts for code generation. This feature is certainly not available with any of the current methods for students looking for roommates, but we think it is incredibly useful to users. They might not have a clue what they really want in a roommate, but we can provide a solution to this problem which has high statistical success rates. "
54,54,10,"1.	Description of the application domain of your choice.  We plan to offer a university-student based goods exchange system. This is particularly targeted at students going to graduate soon and incoming freshmen and transfer students, but is also useful for regular sales and exchanges throughout the semester too.2.	Usefulness.  A lot of students will have things they no longer want or need when they graduate. Currently, most of these students will throw these items away due to the difficulty of finding someone who would be interested in buying, while incoming students have to buy new items as it is difficult to find people selling items that they need. This creates a lot of unnecessary waste and redundant buying. With our project, we will connect sellers and buyers so both can achieve their goals. Currently, the most similar website is Craigslist. However, Craiglist is open to the general public, has no credibility, and is heavily filled with spam posts. Our website will require a .edu email or ID verification and thus is open only to the university community. And when compared against leading e-commerce and Consumer to Consumer (C2C) sites like eBay.com, our system would offer little to no service fee (compared to 13% through eBay). After deployed at various universities and gaining sufficient users we can even allow advanced trading functions like exchange across campuses/universities too. Exchange is open for services too, allowing students to put skills and service in the database: electronics repair, long distance car share (e.g. UIUC to Chicago, Purdue, IUB, etc.)3.	Realness.   Our data is going to be mostly generated by users, people can post items they want to sell or post about items they want to buy. Data will include account info, sale posts, etc.4.	Description of the functionality that you plan to offer.  This is where you talk about how to meet the functionality requirements.  There are two types of functions you need to offer:a.	Basic Functions:  1.) Real data will come from user inputs like account info and user posts. 2.)

55,55,11,"DescriptionOur project aims to give music recommendations to a user based on the user's location, their current mood, and the current weather in that location.Usefulness. A similar application is Spotify's 'Climatune' application, which provides listening history based on the weather. However, the location the information is pulled from is random, and is not tuned to the user's own weather conditions. Also, it is not realtime, and the weather to give recommendations for must be chosen.RealnessOur data will be taken from AccuWeather or a similar weather API service. The music data may come from user's own libraries or from an online source. In the end we hope to use some kind of heuristic to judge what songs are appropriate for what atmospheres.Description of the functionalityOne of our advanced features will be the realtime updating of music suggestions based on changes in the weather as they happen. We think this is a unique feature since most playlists are focused on fixed sets of songs based around a theme, while our recommendation system intends to evolve as time passes.The second advanced feature will be our algorithm to determine the appropriateness of songs for certain atmospheres. This algorithm must also take into account the user's judgement of appropriateness of the suggested music.Basic Functions1. User can request a playlist depending on a mood or weather type. Songs will be pulled from existing music services such as Spotify.2. User can also edit their mood playlists by adding or deleting songs.3. User can also instead of putting in weather simply put in their location and we will pull weather data and generate a matching playlist for the weather at their location.4. User account functionality so that users can save their preferences and playlists."
