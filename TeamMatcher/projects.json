Moreover, on our website, users can chat with people that are interested in the same movie in our chatroom. It will always be fun to talk to people who have same interests! You can also see all the movie theaters near you on our website to choose which one to go to. Just enjoy!Usefulness\u00a0For people who like movies, it\u2019s convenient to search information on our website. The goal of our website is to build a platform to provide useful information and a chance to share comments on movies.Description of the functionality that you plan to offerBasic functions:User login.\u00a0Upload comments on movies.Delete one's own comments.Search for information of a specific movies, or search for all movies in a particular year, or just search movies of an interesting type.Use 'contribute' parameter to represent the contribution of each user, the main goal of this design is to encourage users to post comments.Advanced functions:Want to talk with people who share same interest?

However, the location the information is pulled from is random, and is not tuned to the user's own weather conditions. Also, it is not realtime, and the weather to give recommendations for must be chosen.RealnessOur data will be taken from AccuWeather or a similar weather API service. The music data may come from user's own libraries or from an online source. In the end we hope to use some kind of heuristic to judge what songs are appropriate for what atmospheres.Description of the functionalityOne of our advanced features will be the realtime updating of music suggestions based on changes in the weather as they happen. We think this is a unique feature since most playlists are focused on fixed sets of songs based around a theme, while our recommendation system intends to evolve as time passes.The second advanced feature will be our algorithm to determine the appropriateness of songs for certain atmospheres. This algorithm must also take into account the user's judgement of appropriateness of the suggested music.Basic Functions1. User can request a playlist depending on a mood or weather type. Songs will be pulled from existing music services such as Spotify.2. User can also edit their mood playlists by adding or deleting songs.3. User can also instead of putting in weather simply put in their location and we will pull weather data and generate a matching playlist for the weather at their location.4.

This is particularly targeted at students going to graduate soon and incoming freshmen and transfer students, but is also useful for regular sales and exchanges throughout the semester too.Usefulness.\u00a0A lot of students will have things they no longer want or need when they graduate. Currently, most of these students will throw these items away due to the difficulty of finding someone who would be interested in buying, while incoming students have to buy new items as it is difficult to find people selling items that they need. This creates a lot of unnecessary waste and redundant buying. With our project, we will connect sellers and buyers so both can achieve their goals. Currently, the most similar website is Craigslist. However, Craiglist is open to the general public, has no\u00a0credibility, and is heavily filled with spam posts. Our website will require a .edu email or\u00a0ID verification\u00a0and thus is open only to the university community. And when compared against leading e-commerce and Consumer to Consumer (C2C) sites like eBay.com, our system would offer little to no service fee (compared to 13% through eBay). After deployed at various universities and gaining sufficient users we can even allow advanced trading functions like\u00a0exchange across campuses/universities too.Exchange is open\u00a0for services too, allowing students to put skills and service in the database: electronics repair, long distance car share (e.g. UIUC to Chicago, Purdue, IUB, etc.)Realness.\u00a0\u00a0Our data is going to be mostly generated by users, people can post items they want to sell or post about items they want to buy.

New users will create accounts with .edu email, generating an account in the database (username, password, account profile data). After email verification the new account will have ability to modify account profile (update/delete), post item for sale (insert), manage posts, and make offer/purchase/comment on other posts (insert/update).3.) User can search by item name/keyword, by category, and by post time. Results will be printed/displayed by date, popularity (offers & comments), and by relevance.Advanced Functions:1.) Best offer/price negotiation function with UI built in to site, allow users to send offers to buyer, and allow buyer to set a automatic threshold and accept an offer above certain price point.2.) Extract item information from user posts and crawl real time price online through e-Commerce sites like Amazon.com, BestBuy.com, Walmart.com, etc. for pricing and item specs, and display them in posting page. This reference information makes it easier for buyers when browsing through the posts. It also makes it easier for seller to set price for item.3.) Possible real time bidding function for users.

We will also have a function that could add our own favorite restaurant and then generate the user history.Advanced Functions:\u00a0We will keep track of previously accessed restaurants and have users rate their experiences at those restaurants. Using that data we will adjust our suggestion algorithm based on certain criteria (The rating they gave, the specific tags that the restaurant has such as Chinese or Mexican food etc). Using this we will be able to suggest new restaurants that are based on their previous tastes and preferencesIn addition, we will allow users to log in and create an account storing their previous accessed restaurants. Furthermore, they will be able to access their own and other friend's accounts to accommodate for and adjust to other people's tastes.

Restaurants have attributes that consist of Name, Address, Phone Number, and Type. We believe that Name and Address are the two keys that could identify a uniquely identifiable entities which is Restaurants. Food have attributes that consist of Price, Name, Type, and Rating. We believe that the attribute Name is the key that could identify the entity Food. We also think that Food has a relationship of at most one to Restaurant. Meanwhile, Customer have the attributes of Email, Username, Password, Condition and Email and Username as the keys of the entity set. We think that Restaurant and Customer has the relationship of many to many since multiple customers could have the same relation to the Restaurants and vice versa. The last entity sets, History, consist of (Time and Date) and Restaurant Name. \u00a0We think that History has the relation of at most one with Customers. \u00a0\n", "members": ["Lina Sie linasie2", "Drew Pilgrim pilgrim2", "Enkh-Ider Jargalsaikhan jargals2", "Aldo Sanjoto sanjoto2"], "skills": ["java"]}, {"name": "Same Campus", "desc": "\na.Description Our project is to build an online platform for second-hand goods trading, house subleasing ,ride services and courses tutoring. Currently, our target users are university students. Every user needs to register by their school emails. Through our platform, users could post tasks or take tasks from others. Once you accomplish posted tasks, you will receive corresponding money reward. Similarly if your tasks are solved by other users, you need to pay a certain amount of money. Primarily we focus on following types of tasks. Ride services for students who don\u2019t have their own cars but need rides (preferred long-distance). Tutoring services for students seeking tutors about specific courses. Proofreading for academic writing or application essay review. Second-hand goods and house subleasing trading. Via our website, each user could access resources beyond their social networks.b.UsefulnessWe think our application is useful since we realize that at most of time, people are confined by their social networks while encountering some problems. Our application provides a platform for users to break the restrictions from their own social networks and receive helps from outsides. Most prevailed social network applications don\u2019t have any confine on their user selection. Everyone could have an account or even some of them have multiple accounts. This situations enormously decrease user\u2019s credit standing. The difference between our program and others is that we specifically target on university students.

So in general the data will be primarily based on the input of our users.d.DescriptionBasic functions:Our data comes from real user inputs such as the user information and task information.When user posts a task or creates an account, we will add a tuple in the corresponding table (insert). When user edits the task or edit his/her user information, we will update the tuple in the table (update). When user deletes his/her post, the corresponding tuple will be deleted.

If a student is feeling apprehensive about raising their hand and asking questions in a large class, Open Classroom will take that apprehension away. This application will provide a platform for students to ask and vote on questions for their professor to receive during a lecture or review session. It will give professors the ability to poll students on questions, and provide data and feedback from past questions or years.\u00a0UsefulnessThis application is useful because it provides an integration of the functionality of i-clicker or similar devices, as well as class forums such as piazza, but for live questioning. Our idea is different than other applications which share some functionality, because it works to provide interaction between the class and the lecturer in multiple ways, as well as making use of past data or questions to improve the class experience.RealnessThe data will be created by each class session that uses the application. The data is the questions, and the polling results. It is stored and\u00a0manipulated to give the students and professor a better learning/teaching experience, and enables participation by more students.FunctionalityBasic FunctionsLogin through university account (For both student and Professor)Provide anonymity to students (among students), but not from professor. This allows the students to be more open to asking questions in class.Rating system for questions, so the best rated question can be answered by the professor. This functionality is built so that the professor doesn't get over whelmed by the amount of questions that they get in the class. They may change the \"question show-up\" threshold to be 3, and then only questions that get 3 other up votes will show up on the professors screen. This will also give an impetus to students to ask good questions, and for other students to up vote a question rather than asking the same questions again so the professor can get to see it on their screen.Store data by each class session. All questions for the class session are later accessible by search.Advanced FunctionsRetrieve past class sessions data from a filterable search engine. This will be made possible from having the basic functionality number 4.We will query all data that we have from\u00a0previous runs of the class to see if it was asked in the previous semesters. This will save time for the professor and the student. In addition (If time permits), we intend to pull questions from previous class runs on piazza as well, to increase the amount of data we can query.Stats for in class questions. This will show things like who asked what questions. This functionality will allow the professor to see the effectiveness of questions, the rate at which various students ask questions, and how reaction/response of other students to the questions. The student response to other students questions allows the professor to gauge student understanding of the subject as well (more people up-vote a question == more people confused about the topic explained by the professor).\n", "members": ["Abdullah Motan amotan2", "Seth Primack sprimac2", "Shimul Chaudhary chadhry4", "Jose Morales Valenzuela jmoral39"], "skills": ["java", "php"]}, {"name": "BookGenie", "desc": "\nDescription: We intend to create an online textbook service where students at our university can type in their class codes and find out the textbook they need for that class. Offers from other websites (UIbookstore, Amazon, eBay, Chegg and Facebook) will also be available so users can compare prices and find their best option. We will provide the URL for each offer so they can go to the website they are interested in and make purchases. Moreover, users can also put in information of the books they want to sell and make offers at our service. Prices from different dealers will also be available to help them decide how much they shall set the price.This service solves the problem students have when looking for cheaper options of textbooks. Since there is few website that has integrated resources, students always have to go to various websites and make a lot of searches to find the book they want, while worrying about whether they get the right book or edition. In order to solve this problem, our service will link the book information from the bookstore website to other dealers, and show all corresponding information in one search.\u00a0Usefulness: This will be a very useful service because it solves the problem mentioned above and makes the book searching experience much easier for students. Besides, since it integrates offers from both other websites and individual sellers on Facebook, it also maximizes the chance students find an optimal deal, which will make it welcome in the user group.There is almost no similar service around based on our research. UIbookstore website offers the \u201ccompare price\u201d function, however, there is always no result or very limited information shown for textbook searches. All other websites only provide book and price information without corresponding classes or universities related to it. So our service will be unique by combining class and textbook, and offer information.\u00a0Realness: We will get our data from different book websites. On one side, we will crawl data from UI bookstore website, where we can get class and corresponding textbook information. On the other side, we will crawl data from Amazon, eBay and Chegg for related books, prices and URLs. We will also get data from Facebook textbook and exchange group (if possible) to get individual offers and their contact information.\u00a0Functionality: Basic functions:(1) We will crawl data from the four sites to build a database as mentioned above.(2) Moreover, we will also allow users to enter their own data when they create accounts. The accounts will be updated with their book research and purchase history.Advanced:(1) Parsing data from the four websites to our system automatically.This will be very useful to our service because the offers at other websites or of individual sellers are constantly changing, and we want our user to have the most updated information. Also, the availability of individual offers are updating fast, so it is important for us to give them the correct information(2) Giving time recommendations and price forecasts based on the price trend in historical data.This will be cool because through the analysis of historical data, we can give users recommendations of when is the best time to make purchases and help them save money. If prices always go down after a week school starts, it will be helpful to let the users know so that they can have a better deal.\u00a0\n", "members": ["David Levering (leverin2)", "Pooja Welling (pgwelli2)", "Irina Zhang", "yzhan198)"], "skills": ["java", "php"]}, {"name": "EvCoor\u00a0(Event Coordinator)", "desc": "\nDescription of application:-\u00a0Our application will be a website for people to organize group-based events.

This will primarily be useful for Undergraduate and Graduate students who are looking to join, form, or manage teams for classes or events that they want to participate in, such as hackathons or engineering design competitions. Project management applications like Trello and Asana can help you manage a team and organize your project but are only useful once you actually have a team in place. This application will help you find the ideal team and then give you the tools to manage it.Realness:-\u00a0The data will be almost all user-inputted. Users will register and be able to create and set up groups, and organize events if they have permission/clearance to do so.

For example, earning a notable mention from one of these events might leave a record on the group and their users. This may be listed under achievements by a user and can improve their overall rating.- Users can create groups to target these various events, and after that, users can add, modify, and remove others from their groups. Users will also be able to assign tasks to their team members and designate specific roles for team members.- The main part of the application ties into this: Users will be able to streamline this group formation process and make it easier to create well-balanced and compatible teams. For example, if a group needs a UI designer, the user will be able to search for all UI-designer-tagged users in the database.\u00a0Advanced Features:Advanced Feature 1: Intelligent analysis based on gathered user and event statistics.- As users and their formed groups participate in more and more events and gather recognition, the application will be able to assign various statistics to those users in order to form and identify trends. Using those statistics, the application should be able to analyze the user's capabilities and compatibility in order to recommend the user into certain events, certain groups, or perhaps even to restrict a user out of certain events.- Example 1: A user has been consistently rated low by a particular group of people after working within their group. The system should recognize this and dissuade the user from joining similar groups in the future.- Example 2: A user creates an event. He will be able to specify a certain skill bracket and restrict higher-skilled users from participating in such events, in order to create a more standardized and fair competition.\u00a0Advanced Feature 2: Various intricate visualizations of a user's statistics, so that the user can intuitively understand his own capabilities. It will be implemented in pure HTML5/JavaScript.-\u00a0As we're gathering more and more information about a user, we would have a page where a user can see his own (or maybe others, with permission) data organized and laid out in a pleasing, easy-to-understand manner.

Then print the recommend papers in a ranked order.2 SIMILARITY MEASURE SYSTEMAdvanced recommendation - get similar authorsAbove recommendation just based on query in the database. But didn't involve any algorithm. Here we introduce a similarity measure called PathSim to discovery the similarity by the meta path we select.

We aim to overcome this problem with modern day dating by connecting people through more substantial interests - books! Booking Up is an application that matches people up based on similarities in their reading tastes. Users input their personal information and their interests, like favorite books, authors, and genres, and an algorithm will present them with a list of potential matches that they share similarities with. The user is then free to start conversation with a match if both have expressed interest in the other.Usefulness:\u00a0There are plenty of dating sites already available such as Tinder and Bumble. Our application is unique because it connects people based on their readings interests over something more superficial.

Sometimes this is a pretty difficult job. Suppose one student has a tough semester so that he cannot spare the time to meet his academic advisor. In this case, he needs to check several websites to list future classes and this is a cumbersome process. But with College helper, this job can be done easily. We offer easy managing of a student's academic life. Depending on major, standing and interest, students can get a best-fit of their class schedule. Also they can track their GPA and academic progress which indicates remaining credits and requisite courses to graduation.Secondly, we offer a forum for students who want to find a study-group or share an opinion about a certain class. Many classes use Piazza to ask a question or have a discussion but after finishing the semester, the Piazza system is no longer was managed by anyone,so it is really hard to get useful information for a student who wants to take that class in the future. As soon as a user adds a course to his course timeline, he automatically joins the registered class forum and he can see past discussions, look for study groups easily and use this website as his secondary tool for future classes.UsefulnessCollege helper is useful in two ways. Firstly, they can easily manage their academic work. There are several websites that offer this functionality. Namely, UIUC enterprise, compass 2G and moodle. But the functionality is spread out over these websites. For example, we can see GPA, earned credits, and standing but there is no way we can find a best-fit schedule depending on several factors like preference and major. So it will be absolutely useful if student can use such a system. College helper aims to bring the functionality of all these websites to one place. There is also no centralized source where a student can find opinions and discussions about classes from past students. There are several websites that provide similar information \u00a0like ratemyprofessor.com or koofers.com. But often times, they only show student\u2019s opinion about the professor and not the class itself. College helper offers a simple forum where a student can easily find and interact with students who have taken the course before.RealnessGenerally, we have two data sets: one for the course timeline and other for forum.For the forum, as posts are made by users, we will be storing the threads, comments, user information, date/time of post and which thread each comment was posted in. This data will accumulate as the website is used. There is no initial data.For managing system, we need student\u2019s academic records and information of classes. First of all, user will type basic information like his GPA, taken classes and standing when they sign up to the website. Data about the class will come from each department websites and course catalog provided by UIUC office of registrar. After gathering data, we will combine the information and make a more interactive and comprehensive databaseDescription of functionalityBasic Functions:\u00a0Add, \u00a0remove and view courses from the course timeline. Courses will have all the relevant course information like credit hours, professor, etc. Each course will be assigned a difficulty based on the average grade of students from past semesters. The website will basically be like a combination of DARS and the course catalog. The website will also offer information about core course requirements for graduation depending on the user\u2019s major. Each user will be able to login and view/edit their course timeline and plan out their four years in college. Advanced Functions:We plan to offer an autofill function where depending on the user\u2019s major, we will display a completely filled timeline that would show when the user should take each course over their 4 years. This would require a combination of information about what each major\u2019s core courses are and in what order they need to be taken and how they can all be spread out over the 8 available semesters. This feature can help new students get an idea of what their college timeline should look like and they have some kind of default timeline to begin with which they can then edit according to their preferences. We also plan to offer a forum/message board where students of the same major can communicate. Each major would have their own message board where users can post comments and discuss various things or ask for help if they need it. We can add further complexity by adding tags to comments and then letting users search for comments that only relate to a particular class that they are interested in. \u00a0\n", "members": ["Suyoung Park", "Janak Mehta", "Felipe Arias", "Taiyu Dong"], "skills": ["java", "php"]}, {"name": "On The Rise", "desc": "\nDescription: We plan to design a web application which promotes lesser known artists and connects them with a broader audience.\u00a0Usefulness: Our application has the potential to act as an avenue for independent artists to have their own break in the music industry.

The problem we are trying to solve is the lack of optimal real-time data visualization. Our solution is to create a seamless tool that takes in variable data inputs and presents a user friendly model with API capabilities. UsefulnessThere are existing tools made from utilities like D3.js that are able to visualize an inputed dataset. However, currently, there is not a similar application capable of data visualization for such a wide range of datasets, from stocks to Internet of Things. Our application is a one of a kind tool that makes viewing data simple and can adapt to any user\u2019s needs. What makes us different is that there is a vast amount of data, especially with things like IoT, that do not have a clear means of communicating what the data means. Our advanced functionality solves this problem.RealnessOur data is real data fed from existing datasets (from both hardware like sensors or Nest thermostats as well as software such as Stocks APIs). It is continuous and versatile, meaning that there is a constant stream of data. The beauty of this application that essentially any data can be inputted and our application will adapt to meet the needs of the user.

For the demo, we are going to simulate data from a sensor by creating a script that will generate random numbers from multiple sensors. In addition, each user will have a\u00a0different database for their specific data. Once the data is imported, the user can insert, delete, or update the data (3 of the CRUD operations). The data will also be categorized by either sensor\u00a0in our sensor example or by companies for the stock example.Advanced FunctionPredictive analysis - cool to have this because it can allow users to extrapolate further and use our application to make their own conclusionsComprehensive API support- cool to have this because it can allow us to make our product open source such that other users can modify the codebase to optimize the real-time algorithms, etc.Data visualization- cool to have this because there is a vast amount of data, especially with things like IoT, that do not have a clear means of communicating what the data means. Our advanced functionality solves this problem.Managing multiple user sessions and keeping them isolated- many apps have scenarios in which multiple users are using the site at once, but ours involves modifying a common dataset (e.g. stock data) while keeping this modification isolated to that userReal-Time- cool to have this because instead of taking pre-gathered data (like what D3.js or other tools do) we can optimize and render to deliver immediate resultsHours spent implementing the above functionalities\u00a0\n", "members": ["hanke2", "katyal2", "galeks2", "tshah29"], "skills": ["python"]}, {"name": "Auction Central", "desc": "\nDESCRIPTION/USEFULNESSWe will be creating an auction site with a social media component. eBay is the leader in the online auction world, but due to the fact that nearly any product can be publicly sold on eBay, it is often difficult for the user to find what he/she is looking for. One reason for this could be that sellers are not able to target their auctions to certain groups of people, requiring the buyers to scroll through many unrelated items to find the product they desire. Additionally, Facebook has buying and selling groups, for example, UIUC\u2019s Textbook Exchange group. These groups lack the ability to coordinate auctions (they simply have a \"Message Seller\" button), so sellers can easily overprice or under-price their products, which is sub-optimal. We seek to harness the strengths of both services by combining them together into an auction website allowing you to only see auctions that are of interest to you.REALNESSOur product data will be collected from Amazon.

For the user who doesn't want to sign up an account, they can use keyword search to find useful information they are looking for and also ask or answer questions. For the user who has an account, they can own a custom page after they login so they can focus on the category they care about most. By using at IlliniPost, students of UIUC can have easier and happy daily life.Usefulness(Why useful) First, Many UIUC students such as my friends have many questions about classes such as how many working loads does this class have, how to get A in this class, and where are the chatting groups of this class, and etc. They are also interested in finding good restaurants. However, currently, there is no single platform that can answer those questions together. Students have to find those questions separately, \u00a0and in most cases, they failed to find the answers of those questions because of lacking resources. However, our platform can collect answers of those questions together, and students can post and answer all the questions they focused on this platform, which is very convenient and useful.(Similar applications and their disadvantages) Currently, Yelp can recommend good restaurants, RateMyProfessors can recommend good professors, and Piazza can answer some questions about classes such as how many working load does this class have; however, each of them only has one single function, and students have to go to those websites one by one in order to find the answers. What's more, RateMyProfessors' answers are out of date since it only has the few answers about professors, and sometimes it even does not have any interviews about new professors. Piazza do have some answers about some classes, but they are not sorted well, and students sometimes who have taken this class could not see those questions at Piazza on time, so that they could not answer those questions.(Why our platform \u00a0is different) Our platform, the IlliniPost, can solve the above problems well. Since it is a unique and single platform that contains different sections, students can post all their questions in sorted sections, and students who want to answer those questions can see them on time by looking at specific sections. What's more, we will update the questions and answers on time so that users will not see the out of date information. Unlike Facebook, Twitter and other social networks, illiniPost aims at connecting the previous, current and future UIUC members, and together to make UIUC a better community.RealnessOur website contains data from three parts: Q&A, entertainment and academic. We plan to use Web spider (python) to get data from various website. For Q&A and academic, we can grasp data from reddit, course hero, Quora and Blogs. For entertainment, we can see reviews from Yelp, Facebook and twitter.Also we can add data manually by either writing blogs and registering on our own or inviting UIUC students to post there blogs and questions in our website.Description of FunctionalityBasic Functionality\u00a0Insertion: People will need to post their questions,\u00a0answers\u00a0and experiences on\u00a0illinipost, so adding those data to\u00a0database\u00a0will be essential.Deletion: Since we decide that unregistered user can also make a post on\u00a0illinipost, it will be necessary for the administrator to delete spams and out of date posts.Update: For the user who wants to add or edit their post, update information to\u00a0database\u00a0will also be necessary.Search, list and return results: Search and return also play important roles in our website for users who is looking for a specific content.Advanced FeaturesHot-key clouds: In the main page, we will cross data from different websites, and analyze the search in our website.

It solves the problem of having to rent a car or take a plane if you are going far away, and also reduces the overall cost of the trip per person by splitting up the cost for more people.UsefulnessOur application is useful because it provides an easy and convenient way to get somewhere that you need to go if you don\u2019t have a car or the money to rent one. Instead, you can carpool and use this app the find the person to drive you.There are similar ride sharing applications that already exist, such as Hitcharide, Ride, and Carma Carpool. Our application will be different because it will allow you to string together multiple rides and locations, as well as get off before the intended destination, in order to more flexibly allow people to get where they need to go.RealnessWe will use fake user posts as our data. Each fake post will be a user saying that they intend to drive somewhere, and then other users will be able to browse through these posts to join the rides.

This is a cool feature because even if there is no ride going directly from point A to point B then you will still be able to get there - by going from A to C to B. Additionally, it will allow users to find the shortest trip- or even find the cheapest trip if they so choose.We created a variety of data visualization options integrated with Google Maps and using our databases in interesting ways to provide visualizations for the users to see statistics about rides and the app. This is a cool way for the users to interact with the application and view interesting statistics collected from ride data.\n", "members": ["Dan Volchek volchek2", "Dmitriy Liokumovich liokumo2", "George Gunter gunter1"], "skills": ["java", "php"]}, {"name": "Build your PC", "desc": "\nDescription:We want to build a website that allows users to be able to buy all the components required to build a computer.

The problem Stream Soup is attempting to solve is the disconnect between different streaming services and the content that they provide. A user should be able to simply check Stream Soup to find new/existing TV shows as opposed to logging in to several streaming websites such as Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, Crunchyroll, HBO etc. Along with this, there are several other features further explored in the functionality description section.\u00a0Usefulness:Our application is more efficient than currently available resources because it eliminates the need for users to log in to various applications in order to find TV shows. The main competing application does not provide extra services that Stream Soup would, such as user reviews, recommendations (based on user preferences), integration with Facebook and usage analysis.Realness:Firstly, the primary database required for this project is one containing all of the different available streaming applications. Several streaming services provide a list of the TV shows and films available. Using a basic web scraping tool, such as \"Beautiful Soup\", the relevant data can be extracted and combined to form a larger, more comprehensive database. Several attributes of each show would be recorded such as cast, genre, release year, etc. Another category of data Stream Soup would require would be the information about the users, their reviews and their streaming preferences. This would be obtained using Facebook and user-inputted information. Connecting to other review-based websites (eg. Rotten Tomatoes, imdb, Metacritic) can be directly accessed as opposed to expanding our own database.Functionality Description:Basic Functions:Searching TV show database by attribute such as title, genre, year of release, cast member etc.Add/Remove shows based on new releases/removals from servicesAbility for user to add reviews for TV showsLink to rating websites Advanced Functions:Integration with Facebook to get friends\u2019 recommendationsThis is cool because having friends is cool (or so I\u2019ve heard). In all seriousness, it provides a dimension of interactivity between friends and finding people with similar interests.Usage analysis of various streaming services.This is cool because one can review the TV shows that they\u2019ve seen on various services and determine which ones they would like to continue paying for and satisfy their curiosity in knowing how many hours of my life did I spend watching TV this year (cue existential crisis)?Weighting of user reviewsThis is cool because not everyone uses the same mental scale to review shows, therefore this would normalize the data and give a better depiction of the overall show rating.Concerns:A lot of the data we require is not necessarily available for use, and therefore we anticipate running into certain roadblocks in the creation of Stream Soup.

We will focus on freely-distributable ebooks since we can actually deliver them. We accumulated a database of ebooks from sites like Project Gutenberg and Creative Commons. We allow searching for ebooks, reading ebooks, editting book lists, and visualizing related books.Usefulness and RealnessAtacama is a digital library promoting literacy. Why is promoting literacy important? According to the Nevada Department of Corrections, some prison systems \"plan how many jail cells they will build in the future by how many children are not reading on grade level by third grade.\" We believe that the future of society depends on literacy. Albert Einstein said, \"If you want your children to be intelligent, read them fairy tales. If you want them to be more intelligent, read them more fairy tales.\" Albert Einstein knew that promoting literacy nurtures an intelligent society.Atacama is a digital library and ebook reader whose goal is to promote literacy by remove barriers to literacy. Barriers we address include (i) convenient access to books, (ii) prohibitive cost of books, and (iii) pleasant discovery of new books. The following paragraphs addressed these problems, how Atacama solves them, and how existing services fail to solve them.A public library system serves much of the world. But many people lack convenient access to libraries, especially children. The problem is worsened by budget cuts, limited hours, and even library closings. At Atacama, we believe that the reach and convenience of the internet is greater than that of libraries. Atacama is a digital library which serves books to everyone in the world through the internet.Even with convenient access to a library, the selection may not be satisfactory. Many libraries are small. The inter-library loan system is known to be slow; some request a service fee. Atacama provides instant access to a large library of books for free. Our library consists of free books from Project Gutenberg [note: currently a subset of all the books].After providing access, we believe that the biggest problem is providing a means to discover new books -- too many options may be overwhelming. Eric Schmidt of Google said, \"Every two days now we create as much information as we did from the dawn of civilization up until 2003.\" To remedy, Atacama provides three tools to discover new books: a term frequency-inverse document frequency based search engine, a visual graph with related books, and the ability to share book lists with friends. We hope that these three tools, used individually or together, provide a pleasurable and non-overwhelming book discovery experience.In comparison to existing online services, companies like Amazon and Scribd provide access to books, but often at a prohibitive cost. Projects like Gutenberg provide free books, but lack book discovery features. We combine the best of these services: free books like Gutenberg and useful features like Amazon and Scribd.The main goal of Atacama is to empower society by fostering a curiosity and love of reading. We hope to accomplish this goal by providing an accessible interface to discover and read books. We hope that Atacama will, in-turn, improve society.Description of FunctionalityBasic Functionality\u00a0- Modern and aesthetically pleasing user interface through a Single Page App (SPA) supporting both computers and mobile devices.- Book reading in the browser- Booklist sharing, with user authentication- Advanced Search Engine supporting fielded boolean queries with wildcards and proximity queries- Support for drilling down into searches using facetting- Visualization of related booksAdvanced FeaturesAdvanced Feature 1: Search engineOur advanced free text search allows searching through the entire corpus of books using a complex and powerful query language which support boolean queries, wildcards, and proximity queries. This feature allows you to discover new books which might be of some interest. The search algorithm is based on term frequency-inverse document frequency. This algorithm is widely used as a base for search engines like google. The basic idea is that you have a set of documents, each of which has a list of terms. For each document, you count how many times each term appears. Then you divide that by how many documents the term appears in. This ensures that terms which are unique to a specific document, and appear numerous times in that document, contribute significantly more to a search score than terms which appear in every document a lot of times (An example of the first type of term might be something like 'Alice' in Alice in Wonderland, and the second would be the word 'the'). We also use lists of stopwords so that words that we know are not unique (i.e. 'the') don't adversely effect searching.Our advanced search also allows us to calculate facet values for specific fields. We currently support facetting on author, language, subject, and if the book is public domain or copywrited. This allows you to drill down and refine your search as your looking through the results. This is a quick way to amend your search and add criteria such as 'I only want results that are in english', or 'I only want to see books by Lewis Carroll'.Advanced Function 2: VisualizationOnline stores often provide lists of related books. We want to do something similar but unique -- put related books in a non-linear data structure, a graph.Problems with graph layouts include edge crossings (famous Kuratowski theorem characterizing crossings, it turns out most graphs have crossings), which we want to minimize. We also want to distribute vertices evenly and conform to the frame. We also want connected books to be near each other.Our solution is to use the algorithm from a seminal paper with 4000 citation, Fruchterman and Reingold. The goal: distribute vertices evenly, minimize edge crossings, reflect inherent symmetry. The method: analogy to natural forces, nodes move relative to each other until energy minimized at equilibrium state -- nodes too close together will repel, connected but distant nodes will attract. This is a heuristic for aesthetically pleasing layout; it only converges to a local, not always global, minimum. The model is defined as follows. Let - A be the area of the canvas - graph G with - n_i and n_j be an arbitrary pair of nodes in the graph - p_i and p_j be 2d coordinates of nodes n_i and n_j - N be the number of nodes - C be an adjustable constant - k=C\\sqrt{A/N} - F_a(n_i,n_j) = ((|p_j-p_i|^2)/k)*(p_i-p_j) is an attractive force between each pair of connected nodes - F_r(n_i,n_j) = (-k^2/|p_j-p_i|)*(p_i-p_j) is a repulsive force between all pairs of nodes.Our implementation of this algorithm uses the D3.js visualization library. The visualization started with a simple graph with draggable nodes. We added panning and zooming, a book cover at each node, and hyperlinks to navigate to the next book. We implemented the algorithm described above for node layout. The forces were slightly modified to prevent book covers from overlapping. The algorithm uses D3's time-stepping, which causes some instability at the beginning of simulation, but seems to stabilize.Also, we wrote an algorithm that takes a book id, and returns related books along with their inter-relationships among themselves. This algorithm accumulates statistics including whether authors match, how many tags match, and the text search results.

User can reply to a post or start an asynchronous conversation with people who have common interests.User gets notification when people are interested in his/her event or their individual demands can be potentially satisfied by particular posts.Advanced Functions:(1)Geographical Clustering and Path OptimizationFor students who offer a lift (named as provider) and who request free-riding (named as requester), their location should be considered. We store current location of both providers and requesters in database and keep a record of their destination. If some requesters have the same destination as well as similar time, we should perform geographical clustering based on their location to form different groups. The groups are then assigned to a couple of nearby providers depending on their locations. In this sense, each provider is in charge of several requesters in his/her neighborhood without driving far away to pick up other requesters. After the group and corresponding provider are determined, a recommended path should be generated for providers to pick up each requester in his group. The path is computed based on a weighted graph derived from local maps and should be optimized to reduce the total cost of routing. Tentatively, the clustering can be implemented by K-means algorithm and the path optimization can leverage approaches designed for Dijkstra and Travel Salesman Problem.(2)Related Events RecommendationWe will use data mining technique and based on user\u2019s viewing, searching and posting history to recommend event or other user.

Reviews can be generated by users or retrieved from websites.\u00a0FeaturesBasic Functions:\u00a0-Creating and modifying User Accounts(Registration & Log in)-Uploading and Deleting files-Viewing, Comments and Feedback on \u00a0recipes-Rating and adding tags to recipes-Searching with multiple criteriaAdvanced Function:-Ranking recipes based on their ratings, tags and comments-Recommend recipes based on similarity between users and recommend high-rating, low-calorie recipes:We intend to build a recommender system using user based collaborative filtering method. The basic idea \u00a0is to find the user who is most similar to the current user, and use the ratings from this most similar user to make recommendations. Also, we need to consider the actual usefulness of the recommendation so that we return those results with highest ratings/rankings and lowest calories.\u00a0\n", "members": ["Dehua Chen", "Lingsong Gao", "Patrick Wang"], "skills": ["java", "php"]}, {"name": "Accipere", "desc": "\nDescription:We will be developing Accipere (pronounced \u201cah-chi-PE-ray\u201d), a mobile-friendly Web application for managing receipts digitally and providing users with data on how they spend their money. Usefulness:The application will be useful because it will let you view all your spending in one place, without having to log in to all your bank accounts and then having to write down or calculate all your spending over multiple websites. It will also let you see what items you spent your money on, without forcing you to keep physical copies of the receipt.There are a few different websites with mobile apps available, including https://www.concur.com/, https://www.shoeboxed.com/, and https://www.certify.com/, among others. Our application will be different from theirs because it will be more geared towards individual users, and it will allow you to choose which form of payment you used to pay for the receipt, including be able to choose which account you used to pay for it (credit card 1, credit card 2, debit card 1, checking account 4, etc)Realness:Data Collection: We\u2019ll have real users taking pictures of receipts with their phones and interacting with the central server via a Web interface. \u00a0Most people have to deal with receipts on a daily basis, so plenty of data will be available.Basic Functions:Insert/Update/DeleteWe will insert records into the database when creating a new account, creating a new receipt, and starting a new login session.We will update records by allowing users to change information related to their account and allowing supporting data for receipts to be modified.We will delete records in the database by allowing our users to remove purchases from their history of past purchases.Advanced Functions:One of the advanced features we would like to include is optical character recognition (OCR). This would allow data such as the purchase total to be automatically read from a receipt rather than being manually entered by the user. We think this would be a cool feature, as it would allow users to more quickly store their purchase information in our application, and would just be a great quality-of-life feature.The second advanced feature we would like to implement is heat mapping of users spending habits. This would create a graphical representation of where the user(s) is making purchases based on how many purchases have been recorded within a certain geographical area. We thought this would be a cool feature because it would allow the user to graphically see where they are spending their money, but it could also be of use to businesses, who could potentially use a heat map of all of our users purchase data to determine which areas are hot spots to open stores at.\n", "members": ["Lukasz Borowczak", "Christopher Lewis", "Richard Weeks", "David Wales"], "skills": ["java"]}, {"name": "Engineering Master School Finder", "desc": "\nDescriptionOur goal is to help people who want to pursue an engineering master's degree to find the most appropriate academic programs, according to their desired school ranking, location, applicant\u2019s GPA, GRE and other indicators. Also, based on the essential function of our website, we build a sharing platform that users can share their comments on a specific program and an admission prediction function that using users\u2019 application results to get the admission probability of programs.UsefulnessWhen people want to apply for graduate school, the general procedures waste much precious time. People need to look through dozens of the official website of universities, filter their desiring schools manually during to schools\u2019 ranking or location and so on, then compare the program\u2019s requirements related to their major and their real truth. These manual procedures can be optimized by computer technology.There already are some helpful websites such as US News that can enumerate the top ranking of universities and programs. However, US News cannot restrict the specific condition such as GPA and GRE, and it cannot combine the requirements from clients and find the most appropriate programs for clients. Also, clients of US News cannot share their comments on a specific program which could be very helpful for other applicants.Our website fixes all the problems mentioned above. We will combine the requirements from students and consider students\u2019 basic information, then find and recommend them the most appropriate programs. Also, the comment function and admission prediction function are very helpful for the clients in our website to assess their desiring programs comprehensively.RealnessThe school ranking and program ranking will be collected from US News. The data related to specific school and program such as school\u2019s location, Tel., minimum GPA and so on will be collected from their official websites.Description of the functionalityI.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Basic Functions:Considering the data\u2019s reality and usefulness, we decide to scratch some real-time data from USNews.com, www.harvard.edu, www.uiuc.edu, etc. more than 100 websites, to crawl raw data like contact info, campus location, postal code and so forth.Use mySQL language to insert/update/delete records to the database.Use mySQL language to show tables joint, filter, and so on search operations.Add comments of users into database, like creating a table, comment (userid, programid, commentNo, date, content, grades and marks,)II.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Advanced Functions:1.

We plan to put the power in the user\u2019s hands by giving them an interactive site that helps them build their stock portfolio and continuously enhance it as additional information is gathered.USEFULNESSSimilar to what Yahoo (or RobinHood.com) has, but we are much more customizable.We provide services including making customized query/analysis to users, crawling other social media for most updated news, and making stock transactions via the website. It\u2019s useful in the way that unlike Yahoo and RobinHood provide status quo analysis, the user can make their own analysis or judgement based on their customized query or dig into high volume social media information. With more advanced information, the user can beat the other competitor and gain profit.REALNESSThe data used for this project is all real data. A Python crawler is used to obtain data from various sources, including Yahoo Finance and Open Knowledge Foundation. We use all 500 constituents companies of S&P 500 index as our data sample. S&P 500 index is one the most popular broad stock market index used in the financial market.Three types of data are collected:Company profile data. It provides a summary of each company; the attributes include \u201centerprise value\u201d, \u201ctotal number of shares outstanding\u201d, \u201csector\u201d, \u201caddress\u201d, \u201cbusiness summary\u201d, etc. Stock summary data. It provides a most recent snapshot of each company\u2019s stock information; the attributes include price/earning ratio, beta exposure to the entire stock market, average trading volume, dividend yield, previous 52-week high and low, etc.Stock price history: the daily price history spanning from 2000/1/1 to 2016/12/31 for all 500 stocks are scraped from Yahoo finance. In total, over 1 million records are stored and used for the price history data. Each data record includes information such as ticker, open price, intraday high and low, closing price and total trading volume. FUNCTIONALITYBASIC FUNCTIONSAs suggested above, we shall be using static data from Yahoo for working with our application and our database will contain relations for stocks, stock prices, users and user transactions. We will be able to add/update/delete stock records in the database as well for maintenance purposes (?). This way the users can query relations for specific company stocks, stocks with highest price, observe the daily highs and lows etc. These kinds of queries can be performed using join operations on two or more relations. Once users log into the website and buy/sell the stocks they want, the transaction would be added to the database along with their details. This information will be used for historical tracking purposes of stocks.ADVANCED FUNCTIONS:Stock recommendations based on Price and SectorUsefulness: Our application will be capturing the stock information in database along with their price as well as sectors (eg. tech). When users purchase/sell the stocks these transactions will be captured in our tables as well. So when they sign in to make their next transaction, they would be able to see possible stock suggestions based on their own personal history of past transactions. Additionally, these suggestions would be further filtered by sectors/prices etc so the user can browse all categories with ease. This will add a personal touch for each user with respect to what stocks they see, making our application more useful and intuitive for them. Challenge: This would be a bit challenging for us to implement in technical terms since we will have to add constant monitoring capabilities for individual user transactions. Also this information will have to be stored and maintained for them in a way that it does not mix with other users\u2019 transactions so as to make the suggestions personal. This would involve having a customized polling approach that looks out for specific transactions on tables and verify the suggestions via thorough testing. \u00a0\u00a0Novelty: This feature would be different from other similar applications because usually they indicate the current in-demand stocks based on live stock exchange status rather than user\u2019s choices. This would separate our application from others by making it more customizable and handy from the user\u2019s perspective.\u00a02. Display \u201chot\u201d stocks based on history of user transactionsUsefulness:\u00a0This feature imparts a clean perspective to users as well by helping them see what the other users have been buying lately. By observing which stocks sell the most, the novice users can get a clear idea about what is the current status of the stock market without being overwhelmed by all the exhaustive information available on the web. Experienced users might be comfortable doing this, but when the novice users are starting within the stock-market world, it could be scary for them to absorb all of the market stock patterns at once. Here our feature will prove instrumental in guiding them practically by displaying only the important information in a brief manner, such as the most frequently bought stocks by users. This will start them off to say the least and start gaining a footing, after which they can browse and explore more options as required. Challenge: This will prove to be challenging for us because we will have to monitor the user\u2019s personal transaction history as well as that of the whole user domain in order to display personal as well as general stock recommendations. That hard part would be to separate both features and have individual pollers/analysers for the existing stock trends. That way, we can determine the user-based personal stock recommendations as well as the maximum number of stocks bought by all users for generic recommendations. Also these analysers will have to be fully tested to make sure their behavior is FAD and also that these recommendations change over time based on dynamic user transaction data.Novelty: Again, this approach is different than what the similar applications use because they display everything related to stock trends on their websites. By displaying a sub-set of information based on current user transactions, we impart our application the ability to represent the same stock patterns in a more understable and lucid manner. This guarantees a more user-friendly, time-saving and pleasant UI browsing experience for users which increases the user satisfaction.3. Portfolio Volatility calculatorUsefulness: This will provide a real time risk measure of the user\u2019s portfolio and enables the users to understand the risk of their portfolios and help them make better investment decisions. Challenge: The portfolio volatility calculator will depend on both stock information and the portfolio information in each user\u2019s account. Ideally it would also pre-calculate volatility impact for any stock the user intends to buy or sell.Novelty: The feature is not currently observed in the major finance or stock broker websites.\u00a0\n", "members": ["Jian Du", "Matt Hubbs", "Khushbu Vaishnav"], "skills": ["python", "java", "php"]}]
